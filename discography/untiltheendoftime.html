        <h2>Ballad of a Dead Soulja</h2><br>
        <p>Yeah, ballad of a dead soldier<br>
            This is the ballad of a dead soldier<br>
            This is the ballad of a dead soldier<br>
            Come play the ballad of a dead soldier<br>
            <br>
            The plan, to take command of the whole family<br>
            Though underhanded, to be the man it was planned<br>
            All my road dogs, official mob figures<br>
            Love to act up, the first to bomb when we rob niggas<br>
            I can be lost in my own mind<br>
            To be the boss, only thought's: grip on chrome 9's<br>
            Niggas get tossed up, war scars, battlefield memories<br>
            Swore I saw the devil in my empty glass of Hennessy<br>
            Talkin' to a nigga on a tight leash<br>
            Screamin' "Fuck the police!" as I ride through the night streets<br>
            Little child runnin' wild, towards danger<br>
            What's the cause? Don't be alarmed, death to all strangers<br>
            Maybe I'm a madman<br>
            A pistol grabbin' nigga, unleash the Sandman<br>
            Promise a merciless retaliation, nothin' is colder<br>
            Close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Singing + 2Pac:]</i><br>
            Thug for Life, I will be<br>
            This is the ballad of a dead soldier<br>
            A life of crime I will lead<br>
            Close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier<br>
            If you play the game, you play to win<br>
            This is the ballad of a dead soldier<br>
            It's a crazy world full of sin<br>
            Close your eyes…<br>
            <br>
            Completely lost, revenge at all costs<br>
            Payback's a bitch, switched, now the trick's crossed<br>
            Tossed up and never to be heard of<br>
            A single witness screamin', "Bloody murder, murder!"<br>
            Blast, tell me, homie, what you see now?<br>
            A blind man and a dead body, I'm ready to leave town<br>
            And get my cash though, hook up with Kastro<br>
            Homie had to blast on the task force<br>
            Stupid coppers tried to play us out, never that<br>
            They took my money and my stash; time to get 'em back<br>
            Upon my secret arrival<br>
            Two glock four-fives, time for survival<br>
            Death to my rivals, tell me, what you want, Lord?<br>
            Nobody left after the death of a drug lord<br>
            The situation's critical<br>
            Nothing is colder, than hear the ballad of a dead soldier<br>
            <br>

            <br>
            Be a coward, put yo' hands to the moon<br>
            When my Glocks rang out, the niggas came out, BOOM!<br>
            Who wanna see me in a challenge?<br>
            So merciless, I'm terrifyin' niggas in my ballads<br>
            Do you feel me? Capo or Capi-tan<br>
            One day I'll be the Don; until then, remain strong<br>
            My only fear of death is reincarnation<br>
            Bustin' at my adversaries like a mental patient<br>
            To all my niggas facin' 60 years<br>
            Sheddin' tattooed tears, another suicidal on the tier<br>
            Takin' private planes, tryin' to survive the game<br>
            For all my homies that'll never be alive again<br>
            All they promise us is death, nigga<br>
            Take a breath, come be the last one left, nigga<br>
            It's real now, feel it or fantasize it, ain't nuttin colder<br>
            Listen, you can hear it – the ballad of a dead soldier<br>

            Lil' homies…<br>
            Everybody duckin', my fuckin' lil' homies<br>
            <br>
            Just pay attention; here's a story 'bout my lil' homies<br>
            Straight thuggin', lil' bad young motherfuckers<br>
            Gotta love 'em, you could catch him in his G ride, clutchin' his Glock<br>
            Screamin', "Outlaw!" (West Side motherfucker!), bustin' on my enemy's block<br>
            Educated on these cold streets<br>
            Gettin' money, makin' dummies out the police<br>
            Ain't no peace, for an adolescent nigga too wild, to be a thinker<br>
            Bud smokin' 24/7, everyday drinker<br>
            Got my diploma, but I never learned shit in school<br>
            Mo' money, mo' bitches, mo' murder, fool!<br>
            Always the young niggas gettin' in shit<br>
            She wouldn't stop to conversate, so you called her a bitch (biatch!)<br>
            Bustin' on paper thin motherfuckers<br>
            Drinkin' gin before you get to sinnin' on them busters<br>
            Emptied his clip, passed by like he didn't know me<br>
            Everybody duckin', my fuckin' lil' homies<br>

            Lil' homies on the mash<br>

            Runnin' from these punk police<br>
            'Cause lil' niggas run the streets<br>
            <br>
            I remember, when you was just a lil' G, flirtin' with death<br>
            Playin' "Russian Roulette", screamin', "Kill me!"<br>
            Hey there, young nigga, what you smokin' on?<br>
            Mad at the world 'cause you came from a broken home?<br>
            Love the squad, plus your mob is sick<br>
            A bunch of adolescent niggas spittin' major shit<br>
            Tell me, young nigga, if you die, let me know<br>
            Would your heart feel pain, watchin' as your mother cries?<br>
            Will all your homies ride?<br>
            Or will they all get high, and talk about how you died?<br>
            Young niggas on a mission to compete<br>
            Gettin' G's, packin' heat, bringin' havoc to the fuckin' streets<br>
            Nobody knows why he took a fo'-fo'<br>
            And unloaded on the whole front row (BUCK! BUCK!, BUCK BUCK)<br>
            Try to tell him, but he act like he don't know me<br>
            Pull out his pistol and he show me; my lil' homie<br>
            <br>
            Lil' homies on the ride<br>

            "First 2 Bomb", "16 On Death Row"<br>
            Bustin' on them phony motherfuckers<br>
            'Cause the big homie said so<br>
            Niggas knew I was a nutcase, quick to blast<br>
            Livin' underage, but he'll blaze on your bitch-ass<br>
            Is there a heaven for a G?<br>
            And if it is, will I finally get to be at peace?<br>
            On these streets ain't no peace<br>
            Shell-shocked souls makin' money off of crack sales, young black male!<br>
            Unable to change, 'cause it's a cycle<br>
            Plus nobody knows the evil that they might do<br>
            Lil' Moo, Big Yak, K. Kastro<br>
            Big Malcom, Hussein, call 'em Outlawz<br>
            Tellin' the world to be equipped<br>
            When these young motherfuckers rip shit, they don't quit<br>
            Drew down on me, pulled a pound on me<br>
            Bust like he didn't know me; my lil' homies<br>

        <p><i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            I was so money orientated, initiated as a thug<br>
            Fiendin' for wicked adventures, ambitious as I was<br>
            Picture a nigga on the verge of livin' insane<br>
            I sold my soul for a chance to kick it and bang<br>
            Now tell if I'm wrong<br>
            But sayin' "Fuck the world" got you deeper in my songs<br>
            Drinkin' 'til I earl, spendin' money 'til it's gone<br>
            It's the good life - maybe niggas got it goin' on<br>
            Now maybe if I died, and came back, wouldn't have to slang crack<br>
            Addicted to the game, so obviously we came strapped<br>
            Please forgive me for my wicked ways, fuck a bitch<br>
            Bad Boy niggas eat a dick a day, bumpin' this<br>

        <h2>Letter 2 My Unborn</h2><br>
        <p>To my unborn child…<br>
            To my unborn child<br>
            In case I don't make it<br>
            Just remember, Daddy loves you<br>
            <br>
            Now ever since my birth<br>
            I've been cursed, since I'm born to wile<br>
            In case I never get to holla at my unborn child<br>
            Many things learned in prison, blessed and still livin'<br>
            Trying to earn every penny that I'm gettin', I'm reminiscin'<br>
            To the beginning of my mission<br>
            When I was conceived and came to be in this position<br>
            My momma was a Panther: loud single parent, but she proud<br>
            When she witnessed baby boy rip a crowd<br>
            Went to school, but I dropped out and left the house<br>
            'Cause my mama say I'm good for nothing, so I'm out<br>
            Since I only got one life to live, God forgive me for my sins<br>
            Let me make it and I'll never steal again or deal again<br>
            My only friend is my misery<br>
            Wanting revenge for the agony they did to me<br>
            See, my life ain't promised, but it's sure getting better<br>
            Hope you understand my love letter, to my unborn child<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Natasha Walker:]</i><br>
            I'm writing you a letter<br>
            This is to my unborn child<br>
            Want to let you know I love you<br>
            If you didn't know I feel this way<br>
            'Cause I think about you every day<br>
            I have so much to say<br>
            <br>
            Seems so complicated to escape fate<br>
            And you can never understand till we trade places<br>
            Tell the world I feel guilty for being anxious<br>
            Ain't no way in hell that I could ever be a rapist<br>
            It's hard to face this cold world on a good day<br>
            When will they let the little kids in the hood play?<br>
            I got shot five times, but I'm still breathin'<br>
            Living proof there's a God if you need a reason<br>
            Can I believe in my own fate?<br>
            Will I raise my kids in the right or the wrong way?<br>
            Dear Mama, I'm a man now<br>
            I wanna make it on my own, not a handout<br>
            Make way for a whirlwind prophesized<br>
            I wanna go in peace when I got to die<br>
            On these cold streets, ain't no love, no mercy and no friends<br>
            In case you never see my face again, to my unborn child<br>

            I have so much to say<br>
            <br>
            Dear Lord, can you hear me? Tell me what to say<br>
            To my unborn seed in case I pass away<br>
            Will my child get to feel love?<br>
            Or are we all just cursed to be street thugs?<br>
            'Cause being black hurts, and even worse if you speak first<br>
            Living my life as an Outlaw – what could be worse?<br>
            'Cause maybe if I tried to change<br>
            Who'm I kidding? I'm a thug 'til I die; I'm a rider, mane<br>
            Touch bases, eat lunch in plush places<br>
            Regular criminal oasis awaits us<br>
            If there's a ghetto for true thugs, I'll see you there<br>
            And I'm sorry for not being there<br>
            Just know your daddy was a soldier: Me Against the World<br>
            Bless the boys and all my little girls<br>
            To the Lord: I'm eternal, resting in peace<br>
            Please take care of all my seeds, to my unborn child<br>
            <br>
            Please take care of all my kids and my unborn child<br>
            To my unborn child…<br>
            This letter goes out to my seeds that I might not get to see 'cause of this lifestyle<br>
            Just know your daddy loved you<br>
            Got nothing but love for you<br>
            And all I wanted was for you to have a better life than I had<br>
            'Cause I was out there on a 24 hour 365 grind<br>
            When you get to be my age, you'll understand<br>
            Just know I got love for you<br>
            And I'll see you if there's a ghetto in Heaven<br>
            If there's a ghetto Heaven, I'll be there waiting for you<br>
            Heh heh, take care. Run wild, but be smart<br>
            Follow the rules of the game<br>
            I know sometimes there's confusion<br>
            Rules of the game is gonna get you through it<br>
            All day every day<br>

        <h2>Happy Home</h2><br>
        <p><i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            Home man, hey (what's up). Let's turn this house into a happy home<br>
            This for all the homeboys that couldn't get they happy home<br>
            Let's turn this house into a happy home<br>
            Long as one of us got it, some of us got it<br>
            Let's turn this house into a happy home<br>
            You know how that is, stay down for mine<br>
            Outlaw, look<br>
            <br>
            <i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            Now we've been kickin' it for quite some time<br>
            Remained beside me through my trials in this life of crime<br>
            We done fought so many times I forgot to count<br>
            I never hit you, not a coward, rather leave your house<br>
            Remember back in December when we was tight?<br>
            Sippin' Alize and Cristal, whylin' every night - in my bedroom!<br>
            Promised that I commit to you soon<br>
            Tongue-kissed me every time you seen me step inside a room<br>
            Straight out the hood<br>
            We promised to be good to each other, plus I love you<br>
            So I know you gon' make a good mother<br>
            Just try to understand if I change in time<br>
            It's only 'cause I never owned anything that's mine<br>
            So I'm trying you can stay with my momma but keep the drama to a low<br>
            Never call the police, I never call you bitch or ho'<br>
            We were all born hungry in this world alone<br>
            Finally moved out my mom's house, and got a happy home<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Singer (2Pac):]</i><br>
            Happy home. <br>

            <i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            Born through hard times, ghetto child of mine<br>
            I wonder if you have to suffer for your father's crimes<br>
            To be honest it's a hard road<br>
            Just keep your faith in God, knowin' you'll get scarred though<br>
            Look at him walkin' and talkin', a lil' child with my eyes and mouth<br>
            Father watch over lil' seeds, help me guide them out<br>
            Had to change my whole lifestyle, married my baby's momma<br>
            Made her my wife now, I'm tryin' hard y'all<br>
            Maybe in time I'll be a better man<br>
            Watchin' the older couples, handle it like veterans<br>
            Show me the meanin' of forever and together we rise<br>
            If it would help our child grow, then together we'd die<br>
            Why - question my love, it's so easy to see<br>
            Without my family all I'm left with is a shadow of me<br>
            After all the arguments, and the nights alone<br>
            Now it's time to live the good life, inside a happy home<br>

        <p><i>[Kastro (Napoleon):]</i><br>
            We goin' all out, we goin' all out<br>
            We goin' all out<br>
            Watch your motherfuckin' mouth, niggas!<br>
            (That's right, fuck these fag niggas!)<br>
            Do it, do it, do it!<br>
            <br>
            <i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            Come hell or high water, down to slaughter opposers<br>
            Just another lost soul, stuck, callin' Jehovah<br>
            Outlaw 'til it's over, brandish my strap, back like a cobra<br>
            I stay drunk, 'cause I'm a mad man whenever sober<br>
            On a one-man mission, my ambition's to hold up<br>
            The rap game, while I pluck holes in niggas, like donuts<br>
            And still down to die for all my soldiers, like hillbillies<br>
            They don't fear me, so we feud, bringin' war to the city<br>
            With each breath, death before dishonor<br>
            Never let you swallow me, no apologies, your honor<br>
            A general in war, I'm the first to bomb<br>
            With a squad of trusted killers<br>
            Quick to move shit heavily armed<br>
            I'm similar to Saddam, sometimes I question who's sane<br>
            Like fiends frantic for that last vein, stuck in the game<br>
            I hit the scene like sandstorms, then transform, watch me<br>
            I take the figure of 30 niggas who all got me<br>
            While bitches wonderin' who shot me<br>
            No love, keep a grudge, shootin' slugs like Muammar Gaddafi<br>
            Murder my friends, build a new posse<br>
            We takin' shots at paparazzi, go and fly now, nigga, like Rocky<br>
            You got a lot of nerve to play me<br>
            Another gay rapper, bustin' caps at Jay Z<br>
            (Buck buck buck buck buck!) And still avoid capture<br>
            While y'all caught up in the rapture, still after me<br>
            I'm in Jamaica, sippin' daiquiris, no doubt<br>
            We used to havin' nothin'<br>
            Then grabbin' somethin' and bustin'<br>
            Wanted to be the thug nigga that my old man wasn't<br>
            I can't tour, fear of catchin' cases, litigation<br>
            Niggas playa-hatin', got me crooked in all fifty states<br>
            I'm screamin', "Death Row!"<br>
            Throw my Westside, ain't no thang<br>
            We was raised off drive-bys, brought up to bang<br>
            We claim mob, M.O.B., if you be specific<br>
            We control all cash from Atlantic-Pacific<br>
            And get this: I'm hard to kill when I peel with this live spot<br>
            Father, how the hell did I survive these five shots?<br>
            Live it up or give it up, and like demons<br>
            Late night, hear them screamin', "We goin' all out!"<br>
            <br>
            <i>[E.D.I.:]</i><br>
            We goin' all out, bomb first 'til they fall out<br>
            Take them the war route, without a doubt<br>
            Ball, which means we all ride if it's on<br>
            Each nigga handle your own, bring it on strong<br>
            If you got bills to pay, nigga, go all out<br>
            Bustas playin' with your papes better go all out<br>
            Tryna see the next day, nigga, go all out<br>
            Obstacles in your way, you better go all out<br>

            <i>[Napoleon:]</i><br>
            I'm on my last leg, walkin' through the belly of the beast<br>
            Feelin' like I'm all out, drunk as can be<br>
            It's plain to see, that we mob niggas hidin' in bushes<br>
            Claimin' that they ride rough, but they softer than cushion<br>
            They softer than bitches in the worst way, drownin' in blood<br>
            Outlawz, my blood brothers, I'd die for these thugs<br>
            Say hi to this slug, it's a shame how some niggas on the West Coast was ridin' with 'Pac, but when he died, they went pop<br>
            I'm out in Jers, to the fullest, like some West Coast love<br>
            But after 'Pac stopped rappin', it ain't no West Coast thug<br>
            Just West Coast slut<br>
            To my real niggas stuck in the street game, 'cause rappers like Jay Z be pumpin' Kool-Aid through they veins<br>
            Is it true what I'm sayin'? Slap your soft ass to the floor<br>
            And watch my fo'-fo' put peek holes through your door<br>
            I ride or die, but these other fag niggas be bitin' this<br>
            It's all from my heart when I was writin' this; all out!<br>

            My seductive introduction be specific<br>
            Still elusive, but exclusive's what I give you when I kick it<br>
            And I'm still lifted; niggas can't get with Mr. Wicked<br>
            Picture me flippin' my adversaries, gettin' the dick swiftly<br>
            Niggas is swingin' wild, but they styles miss me<br>
            You can bring that bitch, but your whole click will still get treated shitty<br>
            Business never personal<br>
            I'm up before the sun come up, I'm tired<br>
            Just a ghetto star, a drop top double-R is what I'm ridin'<br>
            Nigga, if you was half the man your bitch was<br>
            Bring yo' artillery when you come for me, 'cause we sick thugs<br>
            No hesitation when I pull and blast, 'cause Syke was bustin'<br>
            Plus, Bo had 'em duckin', screamin', "Get they cash!"<br>
            So now I got the law on me<br>
            My phone's tapped So I had to send word through my lil' homies<br>
            Tell them niggas this the year when they pull the trigger<br>
            Shit, this is what you get, for fuckin' with the wrong nigga<br>
            <br>
            This is what you get<br>
            When you fuckin' with the wrong nigga<br>
            Hehehehe, yeah, nigga, peep it<br>
            <br>
            Before I lay me down to sleep, I pray and thank the Lord<br>
            For givin' me another fruitful day<br>
            I wanna be a peaceful, man, but still when niggas come for me<br>
            All I can see is gettin' 'em killed<br>
            For real, it's how I feel<br>
            Reflect my thoughts, flowin' on these reels<br>
            Make my enemies deal with my steel; they caps peeled<br>
            We still cool, but you played yourself<br>
            Give him the MAC and make him spray hisself, hey<br>
            Fallin' legends clutchin' chrome three-five-seven<br>
            Puttin' two bullets to they dome, wanted to die in Heaven<br>
            Why call in shots? Nobody really as clear as me<br>
            Ain't tryin' to help the feds get a case for conspiracy<br>
            Murder, my foes get disposed of<br>
            We all homies to the death, so my true niggas show me love<br>
            God, forgive me for my lifestyle, a negative figure<br>
            But why they fuckin' with the wrong nigga<br>
            You know?<br>
            <br>
            It's like, why you fuckin' with the wrong nigga?<br>
            <br>
            I was raised by thugs, schooled by killers<br>
            Learned my mathematics skills from real drug dealers<br>
            Tried to rise, but they tried me<br>
            I guess they all had to die, 'cause we tried peace<br>
            I die in these streets<br>
            Blast 'til they recognize<br>
            Still do or die, all my niggas gettin' high, watchin' time fly<br>
            Best strategize on the way to profit<br>
            Best organize how you ride, so they can't stop it<br>
            Then keep it poppin', lot of busters wanna see me fall<br>
            I fucked your bitch, and now this new shit, gon', fade 'em all<br>
            My niggas ball, made a call for some back-up<br>
            For lil' homies and my dogs in the black truck<br>
            "Buck buck" was the sound as they gats burst<br>
            No need for ambulance, baby, bring the black hearse<br>
            Should've never fucked around, buster<br>
            How you figure makin' moves on the wrong nigga<br>
            <br>
            It's what it sounds like, ding ding ding.<br>
            When you fuckin' with the wrong nigga<br>

            By age thirteen I was buckwild, good at my knuckle game<br>
            Made it through a tough childhood never be the same<br>
            Walked in my daddy's shoes<br>
            No time to be a peaceful man had to shatter fools<br>
            That's 'til I put my eyes on you<br>
            God damn, sweetheart you got some thighs on you<br>
            Now I can't wait to get you home, get you all alone<br>
            In my bedroom, baby can we bone, and get it on<br>
            Tell me lady how you like me<br>
            and if you want it harder baby, come and bite me<br>
            but do it lightly; cause that excites me to let it pop<br>
            And if you lick me right, I'll do it all night<br>
            Only got fucked by a drug dealer<br>
            Never felt the real passion of a thug nigga (haha)<br>
            Though I like the way you scream when you lovin' me<br>
            I'm goin' deep, it's the thug in me<br>

            I mean the first motherfuckers that came in the slave ships<br>

            Cause now we overthrow those that placed us in this rotten mess<br>

            Who stands accused of the abuse my own, kind do right<br>
            Pardon, not disregardin' what you thinkin' but you must abandon ship<br>
            Cause once I rip your whole shit is sinkin'<br>
            Supreme ideology, you claim to hold<br>
            Claimin' that we all drug dealers with empty souls<br>

            Shatter, black talon style, thoughts I throw<br>
            It remains in your brain then of course it grows<br>
            Maybe, even your babies can produce and rise<br>
            Picture a life where black babies can survive past five<br>
            But we must have hope, quotin' the reverend from the pulpit<br>
            Refuse to turn the other cheek we must defeat the evil culprit<br>
            Lace me with words of destruction and I'll explode<br>
            But supply me with the will to survive, and watch the world grow<br>
            This ain't bout talkin' 'bout problems, I bring solutions<br>

            You violated, now I'm back to haunt your nights<br>

            Perhaps I was addicted to the dark side<br>
            Somewhere inside my childhood witnessed my heart die<br>
            And even though we both came from the same places<br>
            The money and the fame made us all change places<br>
            How could it be? Through the misery that came to pass<br>
            The hard times make a true friend afraid to ask<br>
            For currency, but you could run to me when you need<br>
            And I'll never leave, honestly<br>
            Someone to believe in, as you can see<br>
            It's a small thing to a true, what could I do?<br>

            'Cause in the hood, true homies make you feel good<br>

            It never stops, when my mama ask me will I change<br>
            I tell her "Yeah," but it's clear<br>
            I'll always be the same; until the end of time<br>

            Ain't nothin' hard about it why you lookin' sad? Shoulda though about it<br>
            Say you learned, I truly doubt it<br>
            I guess you got a problem with affection, kinda loose with the love<br>
            Gettin' freaky with the thug niggas up in the club<br>
            Ask to buy you a drink, you holla Dom Pérignon<br>
            Knowin' I'm a cash getter still I, remain calm<br>
            Let you chill with me; plus you was smilin' 'til the bill miss me<br>
            That's what you get for tryin' to dick me<br>
            Missed me with that "Buy me this, buy me that" syndrome shit<br>
            Bitch get a job if you wanna be rich<br>

            Thuggin' life, and gettin' high<br>
            Why you gangsta, all the time?<br>
            That's a thug's nature (that's a nigga nature)<br>
            Though sometimes, I can deal with it<br>
            I realize, that I'm feelin' it<br>
            It's a love and hate relationship<br>
            But that's a thug's nature<br>
            <br>
            <i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            I'm probably too nice at first, I let you kiss me where it hurts<br>
            Me and you gettin' busy, slingin' dick in the dirt<br>
            Met you at a pool party it was cool to kick it<br>
            See us, tounge-kissin', you was truly with it<br>
            Little ecstasy, Hennessy, mix with me<br>
            Picture me pay for pussy when the dick's for free<br>
            Hey now, where my niggas at? Tell these hoes<br>
            Before I pay; I jerk off, word to Moses<br>
            Visions of you sittin' there sweaty and wet<br>
            Pointin' to the places that you want me to hit<br>
            Give me room all up in the womb, call the cops<br>
            Nigga, hittin' walls 'til them bastard drop<br>
            Label me Makaveli - thug nigga with bite<br>
            Livin' life like a rock star's Friday night<br>
            Make money, get pussy, always keep a pager<br>
            Cell phone in the ride to complete my nature now!<br>

            Curves make a nigga cry, tits and shit<br>
            When I'm locked down beggin' you for porno flicks<br>
            Sneak weed in, help a nigga pass the time<br>
            Put my name tattooed so that ass is mine<br>
            Tell everybody; 'Pac put it down for good<br>

        <h2>When Thugz Cry</h2><br>
        <p>When thugs cry<br>
            Now I lay me down to sleep<br>
            I pray the Lord my guns to keep<br>
            If I die before I wake<br>
            I pray the Lord my soul to take<br>
            Got us dyin'<br>
            When thugs cry, times is hard<br>
            <br>
            Born thuggin', and lovin' the way I came up<br>
            Big money clutchin', bustin' while evadin' cocaine busts<br>
            My pulse rushin', semi clutchin' into insanity<br>
            They shot at my cousin, now we bustin' at they whole family<br>
            The coppers wanna see me buried, I ain't worried<br>
            I got a line on the D.A. 'cause I'm fuckin' his secretary<br>
            I black out and start cussin', bust 'em and touch 'em all<br>
            They panic, and bitches duckin', I rush 'em and fuck 'em all<br>
            I'll probably be an old man before I understand<br>
            Why I have to live my life with pistols close at hand<br>
            Kidnapped my homie's sister, cut her face up bad<br>
            They even raped her, so we blazed they pad<br>
            Automatic shots rang out, on every block<br>
            They puttin' hits out on politicians, even cops<br>
            I ain't lyin', they got me sleepin' with my infrared beams<br>
            And in my dreams I hear motherfuckers screamin'<br>
            What is the meanin' when thugs cry?<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Singer (2Pac):]</i><br>
            Oh, why should you send your child off to die?<br>
            In the streets of chalk where they lie<br>
            Let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry, dear God (when thugs cry)<br>
            Oh my, does it have to be this way?<br>
            Our children of today won't stay wise<br>
            Let the children hear when thugs cry, dear God, oh why?<br>
            <br>
            Maybe my addiction to friction got me buggin'<br>
            Where is the love?, never quit my ambition to thug<br>
            Ain't shed a tear since the old school years of elementary<br>
            Niggas I used to love, enclosed in Penitentiaries<br>
            But still, homie, keep it real, how does it feel<br>
            To lose your life, over something that you did as a kid?<br>
            You all alone, no communication, block on the phone<br>
            Don't get along with your pop, and plus your moms is gone<br>
            Where did we go wrong? I put my soul in the song<br>
            To help us grow in time, but now our minds are gone<br>
            We went from brothers and sisters to niggas and bitches<br>
            We went from welfare livin' to worldwide riches<br>
            But somethin' changed in this dirty game, everything's strange<br>
            Lost all my homies over cocaine, mayne<br>
            See, they ask me if I shed a tear, I ain't lie<br>
            See, you gotta get high or die, 'cause even thugs cry<br>
            <br>
            Oh, why should you send your child off to die?<br>
            In the streets of chalk where they lie<br>
            Let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry, dear God<br>
            Oh my, does it have to be this way?<br>
            Our children of today won't stay wise<br>
            Let the children hear when thugs cry, dear God, oh why?<br>
            <br>
            And all I see is these paranoid bitches, illegal adventures<br>
            Bustin' motherfuckers with uppercuts, I leave 'em with dentures<br>
            'Cause in my criminal mind, nobody violates the Don<br>
            I write your name wit' a piece of paper, now your family's gone<br>
            Why perpetrate like you can handle my team?<br>
            So merciless in my attack I take command of your dreams<br>
            Leavin' motherfuckers drownin' in they own blood<br>
            Clownin', takin' pictures later<br>
            Laugh 'bout them punk bitches that turned snitches<br>
            Regulate my area, the terror I represent<br>
            Makin' your people disappear, you wonderin' where they went<br>
            Am I cold, or is it just I sold my soul?<br>
            Addicted to these streets, never find true peace I'm told<br>
            Come take my body, God, don't let me suffer any longer!<br>
            Smoke a pound of marijuana, so I know it ain't long<br>
            Where is the end to all my misery, is there a close?<br>
            I suppose that's why I murder my foes; when thugs cry<br>
            <br>
            Oh, why should you send your child off to die?<br>
            In the streets of chalk where they lie<br>
            Let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry, dear God<br>
            Oh my, does it have to be this way?<br>
            Our children of today won't stay wise<br>
            Let the children hear when thugs cry, dear God, oh why?<br>

            I shed tattooed tears for years<br>
            For my dead homeboys and my prison peers<br>

            'Til hard-timers in the pen' had to crush his throat<br>
            Probably never even saw it comin'<br>
            Too busy bullshittin', caught him with his mouth runnin'<br>
            Ain't this a bitch? They got me twisted in this game<br>
            The feds and the punk police pointin' pistols at my brain<br>
            I wonder if I'm wrong 'cause I'm thugged out<br>
            My homies murdered execution style runnin' in the drug house<br>
            What was supposed to be a easy hit<br>
            Now shit is flipped, 'cause niggas died over bullshit<br>
            It's not my dream, I'm seein' pictures of a broken man<br>
            No witnesses only the questions of who smoked the man<br>
            Young adolescents in our prime live a life of crime<br>
            Though it ain't logical, we hobble through these tryin' times<br>
            Livin' blind—Lord, help me with my troubled soul<br>
            Why all my homies had to die 'fore they got to grow?<br>
            And right before I put my head on the pillow, say a prayer<br>
            One love to the thugs in Heaven, I'll see you there<br>
            It's written for the young and dumb that wasn't warned<br>

            Since my very first day on this earth, I was cursed<br>
            So, I knew that the birth of a child would make my life worse<br>
            And though it hurt me, there was no distortion<br>
            'Cause wild seeds can't grow, we need more abortions<br>
            Quiet your soul, 'cause you know what you had to do<br>
            And so did victims of a world they never came to<br>
            I understand it's a better day comin', sometimes cats be sleepin' on the dead end, drivin' with the car runnin'<br>
            Blinded, ain't no love in the hood, only hearts torn<br>
            Love letters to the innocent and unborn<br>
            All the babies that died up on the table<br>
            Wasn't able to breathe, 'cause the family wasn't able<br>
            Can't blame her, I would do the same<br>
            All I could give her was my debt and my last name<br>
            'Cause in the game things change, livin' up and down<br>
            This hard life got me walkin' with my head down<br>
            Flashin' frowns wasn't meant to be, was I wrong?<br>
            But I'll never get to know, so I carry on<br>

            <br>
            Guess who's back, and ready to knock off a cop or two<br>
            Cause me and the crew could still get our rocks off<br>
            The penitentiary don't stop a nigga cause he's in jail<br>
            Hell I'm makin' more money on the street from here in a cell<br>
            I'm livin' proper, the coppers is havin' fits<br>
            I just made the profit, you punks ain't stoppin' shit<br>
            I still remember my momma told me<br>
            Find the cop who killed your brother<br>
            Send him to Hell lookin' homely<br>
            Cause a real nigga love the law<br>
            What's raw is a nigga that's above the law<br>
            Keep pressin' your luck and get fucked, huh<br>
            Think a nigga don't know whassup 'cause he's locked up<br>
            But in the meantime, it's get swole get clean time<br>
            Concentrate on gettin' green time<br>
            And as the years go by, they forgot<br>
            About the small time soldier from the block, huh<br>
            To kill the crook they threw the book at me<br>
            Don't worry be nappy, don't even look happy<br>
            Put me in the hole, gave me cold cuts<br>
            Did push-ups until I swole up<br>
            And then they offer me a furlough<br>
            But what they don't know as soon as I get free I'm killin' five mo'<br>
            They asked me if I changed much<br>
            I told em 'Yeah' even though I'm still the same nut<br>
            They started askin' me questions about my brother<br>
            And makin' remarks about my mother, hmm<br>
            Wait a minute, hold up<br>
            Makin' jokes about my folks'll get yours blown up<br>
            They sent me back to the hole for what I told em<br>
            I guess he didn't believe me, so I showed him<br>
            He went home to find a tragedy<br>
            Nigga, that's what you get for tryin' to badger me<br>
            And anybody else that wanna sweat me<br>
            I'm already in jail so you punks can't get me<br>
            You better pray they never see me<br>
            Cause if they let me free, prepare for trouble on the streets<br>
            <br>
            When I get free, huh<br>
            When I get free, huh<br>
            When I get free<br>
            <br>
            When I get free, huh<br>
            When I get free, huh<br>
            When I get free<br>

        <p><i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            Perhaps I was addicted to the dark side<br>
            Somewhere inside my childhood witnessed my heart die<br>
            And even though we both came from the same places<br>
            The money and the fame made us all change places<br>
            How could it be? Through the misery that came to pass<br>
            The hard times make a true friend afraid to ask for currency<br>
            But you could run to me when you need and I'll never leave<br>
            Honestly, someone to believe in, as you can see<br>
            It's a small thang to a true, what could I do?<br>
            Real homies help you get through<br>
            And come to knew he'd do the same thang if he could<br>
            Cause in the hood true homies make you feel good<br>
            And half the times we be actin' up call the cops<br>
            Bringin' a cease to the peace that was on my block<br>
            It never stops, when my mama ask me, "Will I change?"<br>
            I tell her yea, but it's clear I'll always be the same<br>
            Until the end of time <br>
            <br>

            So take, these broken wings<br>
            I need your hands to come and heal me once again<br>

            Please Lord forgive me for my life of sin<br>
            My hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids<br>
            So you know, I don't hang around the house much<br>
            This all night money makin' got me outta touch, shit<br>
            Ain't flashed a smile in a long while<br>
            An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs<br>
            My attitude got me walkin' solo, ride out alone in my lo-lo<br>
            Watchin' the whole world move in slow-mo<br>
            For quiet times, disappear, listen to the ocean<br>
            Smokin' 'Ports, think my thoughts, then it's back to coastin'<br>
            Who can I trust in this cold world?<br>
            My phony homie had a baby by my old girl<br>
            But I ain't trippin' I'm a player I ain't sweatin' him<br>
            I sexed his sister, had her mumble like a Mexican<br>
            His next of kin, no remorse it was meant to happen<br>
            Besides rappin' the only thing I did good was scrappin'<br>
            Until the end of time<br>

            Now who's to say if I was right or wrong?<br>
            To live my life as an Outlaw all along<br>
            Remain strong in this planet full of player haters<br>
            They conversate but Death Row full of demonstrators<br>
            And in the end drinkin' Hennessy made all my enemies envy me<br>
            So cold when I flow eliminatin' easily<br>
            Falls to they knees, they plead for they right to breathe<br>
            While beggin' me to keep the peace (haha)<br>
            When I conceive closer to achieve<br>
            In times of danger don't freeze, time to be a G<br>
            Follow my lead I'll supply everything you need<br>
            An ounce of game and the trainin' to make a G<br>
            Remember me, as an outcast Outlaw<br>
            Another album out, that's what I'm about, more<br>
            Gettin' raw 'til the day I see my casket<br>
            Buried as a G while the whole world remembers me<br>
