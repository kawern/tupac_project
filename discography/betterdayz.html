            Good Evening.<br>
            <i>[*sirens in the background*]</i><br>
            I'm reporting live from Sunset Boulevard where many excited fans have gathered with candles <i>[*crowd starts chanting "2Pac"*]</i> awaiting the much anticipated release, of 2Pac Shakur's latest album, Better Dayz.<br>
            This is yet another post-humous release by 2Pac which, raises the question <br>
            "Where are these songs coming from?" <br>
            It's interesting how the message in these songs is still relevant today.<br>
            Even in his death he's touching people with his lyrics.<br>
            I can feel the energy in the air as they count down to midnight when the album will officially be released.<br>
            Oh, hold on. I think they're starting to countdown now.<br>

        <p>Fugees! Fugees and Mobb Deep<br>
            Tryin' to diss now too, huh?!<br>
            Hahaha! Well, I ain't prejudiced<br>
            I don't give a fuck<br>
            This is what it sounds like<br>
            When we ride on our enemies<br>
            Biatch! When we ride on our enemies<br>
            <br>
            Hey, got some static for some niggas on the other side of town<br>
            Let my little cousin K roll, he's a rider now<br>
            What they want from us motherfuckin' thug niggas?<br>
            Used to love niggas, now I plug niggas, and slug niggas<br>
            Am I wrong? Niggas makin' songs, tryin' to get with us<br>
            Must be gone on stress weed, in the West we trust<br>
            To the chest I bust, then we ride 'til the sun come<br>
            Shinin' back to brighten up the sky; how many die?<br>
            Heard the Fugees was tryin' to do me<br>
            Look, bitch: I'll cut your face, this ain't no motherfuckin' movie<br>
            Then, we watch the other two die slow<br>
            Castrated entertainin' at my motherfuckin' sideshow<br>
            Bam! Set my plan in mo'<br>
            Time to exterminate my foes; I can't stand you hoes<br>
            Uh, now label this my fuckin' trick shot<br>
            My lyrics runnin' all you cowards out of hip-hop<br>

            When we ride on our enemies<br>
            <br>
            Come take a journey through my mind's eye<br>
            You crossed the game, don't explain<br>
            Nigga, time to die; say goodbye<br>
            Watch my eyes when I pull the trigger<br>
            So right before you die, you bow before a bigger nigga<br>
            Now dry your eyes, you was heartless on your hits<br>
            Niggas love to scream "Peace!" after they start some shit<br>
            Pay attention, here's a word to those that robbed me<br>
            I murder you, then I run a train on Mobb Deep<br>
            Don't fuck with me!<br>
            Nigga, you're barely livin', don't you got sickle cell?<br>
            See me have a seizure on stage, you ain't feelin' well<br>
            Hell, how many niggas wanna be involved?<br>
            See, I was only talkin' to Biggie, but I'll kill all of y'all, then ball<br>
            Then tell Da Brat to keep her mouth closed<br>
            Fuck around and get tossed up by the fuckin' Outlawz<br>
            Before I leave, make sure everybody HEARD<br>
            Know I meant every motherfuckin' word<br>
            When we ride on our enemies<br>
            <br>
            When we ride on our enemies<br>

        <h2>Never B Peace</h2><br>
        <p><i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            Now of course I want peace on the streets, but realistically<br>
            Paintin' perfect pictures ain't never worked, my misery<br>
            Was so deep, couldn't sleep through all my pressures<br>
            In my quest for cash I learned fast, usin' violent measures<br>
            Memories of adolescent years, there was unity<br>
            But after puberty, we brought war to our community<br>
            So many bodies droppin', it's gotta stop, I wanna help<br>
            But still I'm steppin', keep my weapon, must protect myself<br>
            The promise of a better tomorrow ain't never reached me<br>
            Plus my teachers was too petrified in class to teach me<br>
            Sippin' Thunderbird and grape Kool-Aid, callin' Earl<br>
            Since my stomach was empty it seduced me to fuck the world<br>
            Watch my lil' homies lose they childhoods to guns<br>
            Nobody cries no more, 'cause we all die for fun<br>
            So why you ask me if I want peace if you can't grant it?<br>
            Niggas fightin' across the whole planet<br>
            So it could never be peace<br>

            Still consumed by the beast?<br>
            And I know there'll never be peace<br>
            That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets <br>

            Y'all babies had babies, now we fightin' each other<br>
            My dawgs got frabies, they bitin' each other<br>
            And it ain't hard to find a friend like mine<br>
            Bigfully is a bullet and he don't mind dyin'<br>
            And I gotta be blind, missed sign after sign<br>
            Time after time after time after time<br>
            And I don't like nobody, they don't like me more<br>
            And I'm good with that finally, but they heard it before<br>
            Dawg, we livin' in a prison, losin' our religion<br>
            On Thanksgivin' we thankful, just for livin' in Hell<br>
            Damn, homie, I don't mean to be harsh<br>
            But there's a devil in the ghetto tryin' to tear it apart<br>
            And if we make it up out, we still stuck in the dark<br>
            Will there ever be peace? Just a piece of my heart. Never!<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Outlawz:]</i><br>
            The only peace we got is a piece of our heart, piece of our mind, or that damn piece that we hold in our waistline<br>
            You feel me, dawg? C'mon, uh<br>
            <br>

            And the victim is you and me, it's sick, but it's true indeed<br>
            The good die, mostly over bullshit, repeatedly<br>
            Deep in me there's a part that wants nothing but love <br>
            But the rest of me know, war is what's waitin' for us<br>
            So I stays ready, keep my pay heavy and boss up<br>
            Stack my funds and my guns, never rely on luck<br>
            Askin' God to point out the impostor<br>
            Never let no weapon formed against me prosper <br>
            'Cause there'll never be peace, so don't rely on it, soldiers dyin' for it, and in the ghetto, they cryin' for it. But fuck peace!<br>

            <i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            She was born a heavy set girl with pigtails and curls<br>
            A heart full of gold, still it won't change the world<br>
            Though she could never understand why <br>
            Some underhanded plans witnessed a man die<br>
            Was only fifteen, should have been a beauty queen, still<br>
            See her cryin' by the caskets when her parents got killed<br>
            Little girl don't cry, cuz even though they died<br>
            You can best believe they're watchin' over thee from the sky<br>
            Never asked for this misery, but look at what you're gettin'<br>
            It's a blessin' in disguise when you find out you're pregnant<br>
            No money, no home, and even though you're all alone<br>
            You gots to do this on your own, so baby gone<br>
            I wish you luck and if you need me, call<br>
            Just come to me and let me feed you all <br>
            I can understand the way it feels when you're fightin' the world<br>
            Facin' all this drama when Mama's just a little girl<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Kimma Hill:]</i><br>
            Mama don't know why<br>
            Mama's just a little girl <br>
            Livin' if she is or not<br>
            Time ain't on her side <br>
            Cause Mama's just a little girl (Mama's just a little girl)<br>
            She gotta hold her head up high <br>
            <br>
            <i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            At sixteen<br>
            What a beautiful thing, the very essence of a jet-black ebony queen<br>
            And who could tell she'd get pregnant at an early age? (what?!)<br>
            She didn't listen, had sex, watch her belly raise (hey)<br>
            Got violated by someone she dated <br>
            If this is fate, I'd hate to see the seeds she created, and so we waited<br>
            Though it takes time to build a body and a mind<br>
            She reclines nine months then finally it's time<br>
            What do we find? Little growin' boy of mine<br>
            With a tortured soul, addicted to a life of crime<br>
            Had no time for the growin' stage<br>
            He learned his values on the streets at an early age <br>
            Watch for police, don't come home (why?)<br>
            Cuz Mama's actin' crazy at the hospit-al<br>
            'Bout to have another baby <br>
            Like a rose from the concrete, growin' within<br>
            Blessed with twins how the hell can Mama raise three men?<br>
            So we began, closest family, such insanity<br>
            A happy home, from one act of inhumanity<br>
            Plus Mama said the seed was corrupted<br>
            Used to rub Her belly, beggin' us to breathe and she'd loved us<br>
            Now, Mama, sits quiet, sippin' peppermint Schnapps<br>
            Turned the house into a spot and made her watch for cops (hey) <br>
            How could Mama bring a thug like me in this world?<br>
            She ain't the cause of all the drama <br>
            Cause Mama's just a little girl<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Kimma Hill:]</i><br>
            Mama don't know why (stupid motherfuckers don't know)<br>
            Mama's just a little girl <br>
            Livin' if she is or not<br>
            Time ain't on her side <br>
            Cause Mama's just a little girl (Mama's just a little girl)<br>
            She gotta hold her head up high <br>
            (How could she raise us) <br>
            <br>
            <i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            Now, will she remain in the same spot?<br>
            The gunshots rang, they came from the 'caine spot<br>
            Now, look here, I see her clutchin' her son in her arms, she's hurt<br>
            Her heart bleeds, now she watched her seed die in the dirt<br>
            Fulfilled prophecy<br>
            But who could stop the grief I walk around, tryin' to hold the world, up on top of me<br>
            I'd probably be an innocent man, still I'm the victim of a curse<br>
            What could be worse? Nothing but pain, since my birth<br>
            Only functions at the Pen', cuz everybody's in<br>
            Payin' back society, I'm guilty of a life of sin<br>
            I watch the drama occur, my eyes blur before I jetted<br>
            I wonder why we all have to die 'fore we get it<br>
            Though we shed tears, so many peers I've done buried<br>
            Worried and scared, knowin' I'ma see the cemetery<br>
            Must be prepared, in this cold world, no one cares<br>
            No! It ain't fair, but we all bear and do our share<br>
            In this land of the underhanded schemes and plans<br>
            Vivid dreams of a nigga havin' G's in hand<br>
            Mama told me not to be a punk<br>
            Fuck what you talkin' about, coward, what you niggas want? (hey)<br>
            There ain't a thing I wouldn't do for my Mama in this world<br>
            Cause you know I ain't mad at cha, you're just a little girl (Heyheyy)<br>
            Hell naw, (that's right) see mama's just a little girl (Mama's just a little girl)<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Kimma Hill:]</i><br>
            Mama don't know why<br>
            Mama's just a little girl (Mama's just a little girl)<br>
            Livin' if she is or not<br>
            (y'all ain't facin' all this drama cause mama just a little girl)<br>
            Time ain't on her side<br>
            Cause Mama's just a little girl (Mama's just a little girl)<br>
            She gotta hold her head up high <br>
            <br>
            <i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            They ask us why we mutilate each other like we do <br>
            And wonder why we hold such little worth for human life (Facin' all this drama, when mama's just a little girl)<br>
            To ask us why we turn from bad to worse, is to ignore from which we came (Mama's just a little girl)<br>
            You see, you wouldn't ask why the rose that grew from the concrete had<br>
            Damaged petals<br>
            On the contrary, we would all celebrate its tenacity<br>
            We would all love its will to reach the sun <br>
            Well, we are the roses (we are the roses)<br>
            This is the concrete (this is the concrete)<br>
            And these are my damaged petals (these are my damaged petals)<br>
            Don't ask me why (don't ask why)<br>
            Thank God, nigga (thank god)<br>
            Ask me how (Ahahaha)<br>
            You see, mama's just a little girl<br>
            Mama (hey)...<br>

            Lifted my head, from my hands, had a palm of tears<br>
            I see bodies gettin' splashed, with acid<br>
            2 shots rang from the plastic Glock, wrapped in plastic<br>

            His family, sheeit, ain't nothing left to be identified<br>

        <p>Shit, tired of getting shot at<br>
            Tired of getting chased by the police and arrested<br>
            Niggaz need a spot where WE can kick it<br>
            A spot where WE belong, that's just for us<br>
            Niggaz ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood<br>
            Y'knahmean? Where do niggaz go when we die?<br>
            Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga<br>
            That's why we go to thug mansion<br>
            That's the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a G<br>
            ... at thug mansion<br>
            <br>
            <i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind<br>
            So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times<br>
            I once contemplated suicide, and woulda tried<br>
            But when I held that 9, all I could see was my momma's eyes<br>
            No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble<br>
            Not knowing it's hard to carry on when no one loves you<br>
            Picture me inside the misery of poverty<br>
            No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived<br>
            Praying hard for better days, promise to hold on<br>
            Me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on<br>
            We found a family spot to kick it<br>
            Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit<br>
            A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's<br>
            We still visualize places, that we can roll in peace<br>
            And in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go in fast<br>
            I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion<br>
            <br>

            Every hour, cause it's all good<br>
            Leave all the stress from the world outside<br>
            Every wrong done will be alright (I wanna go)<br>
            Nothing but peace (I wanna go) love (I wanna go nigga)<br>

            A place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide<br>
            Not to start beef but spark trees, no cops rolling by<br>
            No policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets<br>
            No reason, for nobody's momma to cry<br>
            See I'm a good guy, I'm trying to stick around for my daughter<br>
            But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her<br>
            This whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me<br>
            Only difference from me and Ossie Davis, gray hair maybe<br>
            Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much suffering<br>
            I'm just twenty-some-odd years, I done lost my mother<br>
            And I cried tears of joy, I know she smiles on her boy<br>
            I dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur<br>
            Cause like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war<br>
            And just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more<br>
            Cause one day we'll all be together, sipping heavenly champagne<br>
            where angels soar, with golden wings in thug's mansion<br>

            Tell the homies I'm in heaven and they ain't got hoods<br>
            Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook<br>
            Dripping peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke<br>
            Then some lady named Billie Holiday<br>
            Sang sitting there kicking it with Malcolm, 'til the day came<br>
            Little LaTasha sho' grown<br>
            Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home<br>
            Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us<br>
            When Miles Davis cutting lose with the band<br>
            Just think of all the people that you knew in the past<br>
            that passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last<br>
            Picture a place that they exist, together<br>
            There has to be a place better than this, in heaven<br>

        <p>Damn, take a ride to my block<br>
            My block, that's right! Hehe<br>
            'Round my motherfuckin' way<br>
            <br>
            They got a nigga sheddin' tears, reminiscin' on my past fears<br>
            'Cause shit was hectic for me last year<br>
            It appears that I've been marked for death, my heartless breast<br>
            The underlying cause of my arrest, my life is stressed<br>
            And no rest, forever weary; my eyes stay teary<br>
            For all the brothers that are buried in the cemetery<br>
            Shit is scary, how black-on-black crime legendary<br>
            But at times unnecessary, I'm getting worried<br>
            Teardrops and closed caskets, the three strikes law is drastic<br>
            And certain death for us ghetto bastards<br>
            What can we do when we're arrested but open fire?<br>
            Life in the pen ain't for me, 'cause I'd rather die<br>
            But don't cry through your despair<br>
            I wonder if the Lord still cares for us niggas on welfare<br>
            And who cares if we survive? The only time they notice a nigga is when he's clutchin' on a four-five<br>
            My neighborhood ain't the same, 'cause all these little babies going crazy and they suffering in the game<br>
            And I swear it's like a trap<br>
            But I ain't given up on the hood, it's all good when I go back<br>
            Hoes show me love, niggas give me props<br>
            Forever hop, 'cause it don't stop – on my block<br>
            <br>
            Living life is but a dream<br>
            Hard times is all we seen (on my block)<br>
            Every block is kind to me<br>
            But on the block we still pray<br>
            But on the block we still pray<br>
            <br>
            Now shit's constantly hot on my block<br>
            It never fails to be gunshots<br>
            Can't explain a mother's pain when her son drops<br>
            Black males living in Hell; when will we prevail?<br>
            Fearing jail, but crack sales got me living well<br>
            And in a sense I'm suicidal with this Thug's Life<br>
            Staying strapped, forever trapped in this drug life<br>
            God, help me, 'cause I'm starving, can't get a job<br>
            So I resort to violent robberies, my life is hard<br>
            Can't sleep, 'cause all the dirt make my heart hurt<br>
            Put in work and shed tears for my dead peers<br>
            Mislead from childhood where I went astray<br>
            'Til this day I still pray for a better way<br>
            Can't help but feel hopeless and heartbroke<br>
            From the start I felt the racism 'cause I'm dark<br>
            Couldn't quit, the bullshit make me represent<br>
            Hit the bar and played the star everywhere I went<br>
            In my heart I felt alone, out here on my own<br>
            I close my eyes and picture home – on my block<br>
            <br>
            Living life is but a dream<br>
            Hard times is all we seen (on my block)<br>
            Every block is kind to me<br>
            But on the block we still pray<br>
            But on the block we still pray<br>
            <br>
            And I can't help but wonder why so many young kids had to die; caught strays from AK's in a drive-by<br>
            Swollen pride and homicide don't coincide<br>
            Brothers cry for broken lives; Mama, come inside!<br>
            'Cause our block is filled with danger<br>
            Used to be a close knit community<br>
            But now we're all cold strangers<br>
            Time changes us to stone, them crack pipes<br>
            All up and down the block, exterminating black life<br>
            But I can't blame the dealers; my mama's welfare check has brought the next man chrome wheels<br>
            Shit's real, I know you feel my tragedy<br>
            A single mother with a problem child, daddy free<br>
            Hanging out, picking up game, sippin' cheap liquor<br>
            Gaming the hoochies, hoping I can get to sleep with her<br>
            It's a man's world, staying strapped<br>
            Fantasies of a nigga living phat but held back<br>
            Pipe dreams can make the night seem hopeless<br>
            Wide eyed and losing focus – on my block<br>
            <br>
            Living life is but a dream<br>
            Hard times is all we seen (on my block)<br>
            Every block is kind to me<br>
            But on the block we still pray<br>
            But on the block we still pray<br>
            <br>
            And block parties in the projects lasting way past daylight<br>
            A young nigga learned to break, right?<br>
            Used to play fight with my homies, but they stuck in the pen<br>
            I send them ends, but it's tough on a friend<br>
            In my mind I see the same motherfuckers ballin'<br>
            Alcohol will make a lazy nigga slip and fall, miss his call<br>
            I know the young niggas understand this<br>
            Growing up in this world where everything is scandalous<br>
            I reminisce on the fast times, past crimes<br>
            Tryin' to cop a slice of pizza with my last dime<br>
            Can't explain, just what attracts me to this dirty game<br>
            Gold chains, some extra change, and the street fame<br>
            And what's strange is everybody know my name<br>
            Swear they all know me, and lots of cash make a nigga change<br>
            I hit the green just to maintain, feeling pain<br>
            For all the niggas that I lost to the game – from my block<br>
            <br>
            Living life is but a dream<br>
            Hard times is all we seen (on my block)<br>

            But on the block we still pray<br>
            <br>
            Rest in peace to all the motherfuckers that passed away<br>
            From all the blocks that I'm from<br>
            112 street, 7th Avenue, New York, Uptown, knahmsayin'?<br>

            Oakland, can't forget Oaktown – that's my block for sure<br>
            And all the other blocks around this motherfucker<br>
            Houston, Florida, St. Louis, Tennessee, Miami, Chicago<br>

        <h2>Thugz Mansion</h2><br>
        <p><i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            Shit, tired of gettin' shot at<br>
            Tired of gettin' chased by the police and arrested<br>
            Niggas need a spot where we can kick it<br>
            A spot where WE belong, that's just for us<br>
            Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood<br>
            Y'knahmean? Where do niggas go when we die?<br>
            Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga<br>
            That's why we go to thug mansion<br>
            That's the only place where thugs get in free<br>
            And you gotta be a G, at thug mansion<br>
            <br>
            <i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind<br>
            So much pressure in this life of mine<br>
            I cry at times, I once contemplated suicide<br>
            And would've tried, but when I held that 9<br>
            All I could see was my mama's eyes<br>
            No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble<br>
            Not knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you<br>
            Picture me inside the misery of poverty<br>
            No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived<br>
            Prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on<br>
            Me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on<br>
            We found a finally spot to kick it<br>
            Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit<br>
            A spot where we can smoke in peace<br>
            And even though we G's<br>
            We still visualize places that we can roll in peace<br>
            And in my mind's eye I see this place<br>
            The players go and pass it<br>
            I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Anthony Hamilton:]</i><br>
            Ain't no place I'd rather be<br>
            Chillin' with homies and family<br>
            Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky<br>
            Ain't no place I'd rather be<br>
            Only place that's right for me<br>
            Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky<br>

            Will I survive all the fights and the darkness?<br>
            Trouble sparks, they tell me, "Home is where the heart is."<br>
            Dear departed, I shed tattooed tears<br>
            And couldn't sleep good for multiple years<br>
            Witness peers catch gunshots; nobody cares<br>
            Seen the politicians ban us<br>
            They'd rather see us locked in chains<br>
            Please explain why they can't stand us<br>
            Is there a way for me to change?<br>
            Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?<br>
            I need a place to rest my head<br>
            With the little bit of homeboys that remains<br>
            'Cause all the rest dead<br>
            Is there a spot for us to roll? If you find it<br>
            I'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go<br>
            How can I be peaceful? I'm comin' from the bottom<br>
            Watch my daddy scream, "Peace!"<br>
            While the other man shot him<br>
            I need a house that's full of love, when I need to escape<br>
            The deadly places slingin' drugs, in thug's mansion<br>

            Dear Mama, don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good<br>
            Tell the homies I'm in heaven and they ain't got hoods<br>
            Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook<br>
            Drinkin' peppermint Schnapps<br>
            With Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke<br>
            Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang<br>
            Sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm, 'til the day came<br>
            Little Latasha sho' grown; tell the lady in the liquor store<br>
            That she's forgiven, so come home<br>
            Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us<br>
            When Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band<br>
            Just think of all the people that you knew in the past<br>
            that passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last<br>
            Picture a place that they exist, together<br>
            There has to be a place better than this, in heaven<br>
            So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'<br>

            I try to picture myself in this position but remain silent<br>
            I get to thinkin' 'bout this shit we been through<br>
            We close like kin, but you remain my friend too<br>
            This life of sin, done got the both of us in trouble<br>
            But you always stay down for a nigga, so that's why I love you<br>
            Reminiscin' needin' tissues, fightin' over childish issues<br>
            Swear I can't live with you<br>

            And live my life trouble free, I see<br>

            Can't get too close my enemies, they see ghosts, they envy me<br>
            Plus we been beefin' with the East Coast, with casualties<br>
            Got stopped in traffic, had a warrant, so they gaffled me<br>
            But while I'm gone, watch my business and my back for me<br>

            Faced with the demons<br>
            Addicted to hearin' victims screamin'<br>
            Guess we was evil since birth, product of cursed semens<br>
            'Cause even our birthdays is cursed days<br>
            A born thug in the first place, the worst ways<br>
            I'd love to see the block in peace<br>
            With no more dealers and crooked cops<br>
            The only way to stop the beast<br>
            And only we can change<br>
            It's up to us to clean up the streets, it ain't the same<br>
            Too many murders, too many funerals, and too many tears<br>
            Just seen another brother buried<br>
            Plus I knew him for years<br>
            Passed by his family, but what could I say?<br>
            Keep yo' head up and try to keep the faith<br>
            And pray for better days<br>
            <br>
            Better days, better days<br>
            Hey, better days<br>
            Got me thinkin' about better days<br>
            Better days, better days, better days<br>
            Hey, better days<br>
            Got me thinkin' about better days<br>
            <br>
            Thinkin' back as an adolescent, who would've guessed<br>
            That in my future years I'd be stressin'?<br>
            Some say the ghetto's sick and corrupted<br>
            Plus my P.O. won't let me hang<br>
            With the brothers I grew up with<br>
            Tryin' to keep my head up and stay strong<br>
            All my homies slangin' yayo all day long<br>
            But they wrong, so I'm solo and so broke<br>
            Savin' up for some Jordan's, 'cause they dope<br>
            I got a girl and I love her, but she broke too<br>
            And so am I; I can't take her to the places she wanna go to<br>
            So, we argue and play fight, all day and night<br>
            Makin' passionate love 'til the daylight<br>
            Plus we about to get evicted, can't pay the rent<br>
            Guess it's time to see who really is your friend<br>
            Tell me you pregnant and I'm amazed<br>
            So many blessings while we stressin'<br>
            Lookin' for them better days<br>
            <br>
            Better days, better days<br>
            Hey, better days<br>

            Hey, better days<br>
            Got me thinkin' about better days<br>
            <br>
            Now, me and you was real cool, hell on them square fools<br>
            Since back in high school, we was true, me and you<br>
            Hardly parted or separated, we stayed faded<br>
            Affiliated with gang-bangers and still made it<br>
            Up in the gym, mess with me, gotta mess with him<br>
            Still dressin' like grown men when rollin'<br>
            Out in the dark, smokin' Newports, gamin' marks<br>
            Got a place in my heart, homie, stay smart<br>
            Locked you up in the pen, and gave you three to ten<br>
            I send you letters with naked flicks of old friends<br>
            Hopin' you well, I know it's hell<br>
            Doin' time in the cells, you need mail when you in jail<br>
            And me, I'm doin' cool<br>
            I settled down, had a family, workin' a night school<br>
            Every once in a while, I reminisce<br>
            And I wonder how we ever came to this; I miss the better days<br>
            <br>
            Better days, better days<br>
            Hey, better days<br>
            Got me thinkin' about better days<br>

            Hey, better days<br>
            Got me thinkin' about better days<br>

            They got me hot when they shot me, plotted<br>
            My revenge to increase my ends; enemies gettin' dropped<br>

            I can't complain, I've seen my fair share of the fame<br>
            It won't change me, now I've got this piece of change<br>
            I feel strange, I got so used to the hood<br>
            That when I finally got out at first it ain't feel good<br>
            I was just a baby, still retarded from slavery<br>
            When we struggle to shovel shit ain't nobody saved me<br>
            Ghetto ain't made me, I made myself<br>
            Poverty raised me, thinking ain't no help<br>
            I pray for my health, my mind, and my family too<br>
            State of myself, my grind, and my family crew<br>
            Where one hand washes the other<br>
            No, we ain't blood, but we still real brothers<br>
            The struggle is real, nothin' can steal what we build<br>
            And that remains the same 'til the day that we killed<br>
            And that's real, life that I was aimed to be<br>
            Love by my family tree, that's fame to me – how about it?<br>

            Picture of perfection, the object of a nigga affection<br>
            Partners in passionate sex, a place to put my erection<br>
            Fantasies of you in submission, freaky positions<br>
            Pushin', pullin' and twistin' I'm on a mission got me on the mash<br>
            Tried to dig, you was screamin' when I did<br>
            Steady yellin' out spots for me to hit, and "aw shit"<br>
            Soon as I seen her saw us playin' hide the weiner<br>
            Wanna "Freak Like Me", fuck Adina<br>
            Up and down is the object, side to side<br>
            Make you holla out my name when a thug nigga ride, "Can I cum inside?"<br>
            Say you don't feel it that's a lie, you just scared to get this<br>
            Penitentiary dick, the trot caught your eye<br>
            When I walked by, I said, "Hi"<br>
            But you was so shy, I can't lie, damn near stuttered when you walked by<br>
            You want me to lick it and even worse<br>
            Got your heart set on me goin' first, and that ain't no fair exchange<br>

            And if you willin', then we can ride until the sun shine<br>
            And just for fun, I betchu I can make you cum 61 times<br>
            Close your eyes, let me heat it up<br>
            Cause when we fuck I refuse to bust a nut until I beat it up<br>
            Drop the top, time to fuck while the wind blow<br>
            Baby throw yo' legs out the window<br>
            Remember on the balcony, bend over baby bounce on me<br>
            And let me hit it where it counts and flee<br>
            Remember me? "I Get Around," and I'm haunted by my "Temptations"<br>
            Sexual participation, my motivation<br>
            Even though I like the way you work it<br>
            You don't deserve it cause you walk around actin' like you perfect<br>
            Took a while but I finally got it, and like a boss player<br>

        <h2>Who Do You Believe In</h2><br>
        <p><i>[Intro: 2Pac]</i><br>
            Let us pray<br>
            Heavenly Father, hear a nigga down here<br>
            Before I go to sleep<br>
            Tell me, who do you believe in?<br>
            Who do you believe in?<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Verse One: 2Pac]</i><br>
            I see mothers in black cryin, brothers in packs dyin<br>
            Plus everybody's high, too doped up to ask why<br>
            Watchin our own downfall, witness the end<br>
            It's like we don't believe in God cause we livin in sin<br>
            I asked my homie on the block why he strapped, he laughed<br>
            Pointed his pistol as the cop car passed and blast<br>
            It's just another murder, nobody mourns no more<br>
            My tear drops gettin bigger but can't figure what I'm cryin for<br>
            Is it the miniature caskets, little babies<br>
            Victims of a stray, from drug dealers gone crazy<br>
            Maybe it's just the drugs, visions of how the block was<br>
            Crack came and it was strange how it rocked us<br>
            Perhaps the underlyin fact they hide explain genocide<br>
            It's when we ride on our own kind<br>
            What is it we all fear, reflections in the mirror<br>
            We can't escape fate, the end is gettin nearer<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Chorus 2X: 2Pac]</i><br>
            Who do you believe in?<br>
            I put my faith in God, blessed and still breathin<br>
            And even though it's hard, that's who I believe in<br>
            Before I'm leavin, I'm askin the grievin - who do you believe in?<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Verse Two: 2Pac]</i><br>
            Can't close my eyes cause all I see is terror<br>
            I hate the man in the mirror<br>
            Cause his reflection makes the pain turn realer<br>
            Times of Armageddeon, murder in mass amounts<br>
            In this society where only gettin the cash counts<br>
            I started out as a beginner<br>
            Entered the criminal lifestyle became a sinner<br>
            I make my money and vacate, evade prison<br>
            Went from the chosen one to outcast, unforgiven<br>
            And all the Hennessy and weed can't hide, the pain I feel inside<br>
            You know, it's like I'm livin just to die<br>
            I fall on my knees and beg for mercy, not knowin if I'm worthy<br>
            Livin life thinkin no man can hurt me<br>
            So I'm askin -- before I lay me down to sleep<br>
            Before you judge me, look at all the shit you did to me, my misery<br>
            I rose up from the slums, made it out the flames<br>
            In my search for fame will I change?  I'm askin<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Chorus]</i><br>
            <br>
            <i>[Verse Three: Kadafi]</i><br>
            Faith in Allah, believe in me and this plastic<br>
            Cause so far I done witnessed to many dead niggaz in caskets<br>
            With they chest plates stretched like elastic<br>
            And what's worse I'm on front line, holdin down camp, still mashin<br>
            Heard my cousin, one of the old heads from the block<br>
            Just came home October of '95 back in Yardsville stuck<br>
            with a three to five, if he don't act up, now he realize<br>
            If you don't stay wise, then in this game you fucked<br>
            Talk to my baby girl, give me the word on what she heard<br>
            One of the grimmies is snitchin, Diamond a stool pigeon I talked to him<br>
            He said he didn't, my man said he did, in fact he's sure<br>
            Cause he just came home off of bail<br>
            <br>
            <i>[2Pac]</i> Now tell me<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Chorus]</i><br>
            <br>
            <i>[Outro: spoken word]</i><br>
            Who do you believe in?<br>
            Is it Buddah, Jehovah, or Jah?  Or Allah?<br>
            Is it Jesus?  Is it God?  Or is just yourself?<br>
            Definately not to be imposed, being a demon<br>
            Because this is the joy of believing!<br>
            Men, to believe in yourselves<br>
            But for sure, the higher power<br>
            Resides only to ride in the heart of the true<br>
            From the soul, of the man; for truth never has an alibi<br>
            In the poetry, or in it's realm<br>
            That's what pulls all words together<br>
            Just to understand, that every man, is his OWN man<br>
            And only man can satisfy the man<br>
            Only the soul of the man, the feelings of the man<br>
            The for realness of the man<br>
            You can't shake the man when you feel the man you know the man<br>
            And you gotta call yourself because you are that man<br>
            <br>

            I grew up on the other side of perfect, a life of hurtin' <br>
            Man, I still hustle, so I'm dyin' certain<br>
            So I spent your time in poor and workin', I see no reason<br>
            So I stay ballin' season to season <br>
            Why you stuck thinkin' that they give a fuck?<br>
            <br>

            You tell me my world is in peace, but nigga, you're lyin'<br>
            'Cause half of my niggas long gone<br>
            Buried in the dirt just for tryin'<br>
            Sometimes I think my block is dyin' and that is awful<br>
            To wake up to another day, shit ain't changed that's all fool<br>
            I wake up sweatin', dreamin', coughin'<br>
            Seein' me upside down backwards head twisted <br>
            While I'm layin' in the coffin<br>
            The shit comes around so often; so tell me somethin'<br>
            Before I take it out on the world, and get to dumpin' <br>
            Nigga, I been so through pain, go through the struggle<br>
            Doin' the same thing you did at my age, and that's hustlin'<br>
            On the edge of straight bustin' <br>
            Well, since you don't give a fuck, I be frontin'<br>
            And I'ma drink my Hennessy like it ain't nothin'<br>
            <br>
