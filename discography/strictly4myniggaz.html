            And the punk police can't fade me, and maybe<br>
            We can have peace someday, G<br>
            But right now I got my mind set up<br>
            Looking down the barrel of my nine, get up<br>
            Cause it's time to make the payback fat<br>
            To my brothers on the block better stay strapped, black<br>
            And accept no substitutes<br>
            I bring truth to the youth tear the roof off the whole school<br>

            See ya when they free ya if not when they shove me in<br>
            Once again it's an all out scrap<br>
            Keep your hands on ya gat, and now ya boys watch ya back<br>
            Cause in the alleys out in Cali I'mma tell ya<br>
            Mess with the best and the vest couldn't help ya<br>
            Scream, if ya feel me; see it clearly?<br>

            I guess cause I'm black born<br>
            I'm supposed to say peace, sing songs, and get capped on<br>
            But it's time for a new plan, BAM!<br>
            I'll be swinging like a one man, clan<br>

            Now my homies in the backstreets, the blackstreets<br>
            They feel me when they rolling in they fat jeeps<br>
            This ain't just a rap song, a black song<br>
            Telling all my brothers, get they strap on<br>

            I guess nobody loves a real nigga-slash-rap singer<br>
            I thought I'd bring a little truth to the young troops<br>
            I brought proof that the niggas need guns too<br>
            It's not to be a racist, but let's face this:<br>
            wouldn't you if we could trade places?<br>
            I got lynched by some crooked cops, and to this day<br>

            Ain't that a bitch, some officers are getting rich<br>
            Whooping on thugs and robbing drug dealers for they shit<br>

            Muthafucker Rednecks all the same<br>

            You mutha-fuckas gonna pay the price<br>
            Can't make a Black life, don't take a Black life<br>
            It's on, the next real nigga fall dead<br>
            Dread, jheri curl, process, or bald head<br>
            Be prepared for the smoke to bust<br>
            What niggas need to do is start loc'in up<br>
            United we stand divided we fall<br>
            They can shoot one nigga, but they can't take us all<br>
            Let's get along with the Mexicans<br>
            And we can all have peace on the sets again<br>
            Imagine that if it took place (ha ha ha)<br>
            Keeping the smile off they White face<br>
            I ain't racist but lets trade places<br>
            Trace the hate 'n face it <br>
            One nigga teach two niggas<br>
            Three teach four niggas<br>
            And them niggas teach more niggas<br>
            And when we blast <br>
            That'll be the biggest blast you've heard<br>

            I'm used to being poor, but now I'm sick of struggling<br>
            I thought about bumping, but mother-fuck juggling<br>
            I know it lasts longer, gets my pockets thicker<br>
            But I'd rather use my gun cause I get the money quicker, so bust it<br>
            Look as I cut the records hard to eject<br>

            Eye on the Mac cause the dogg got it going on<br>

            I'm just in it for the money, don't be a punk snitch<br>
            When I yank up my gun, don't run don't bitch<br>
            Cause ya know if you do, you'll be laying in a ditch<br>
            You'll get your stupid ass blown out the frame<br>
            Cause I'm playing to win, and survive in the game<br>

            Wicked as I flip, don't trip, get a grip<br>
            It'll kick, if the bass line's thick, it's a hit<br>
            Everybody's got a mic now, it's like a hobby<br>
            But more like a job, cause bootleggers tryin' to rob me!<br>
            And little man wants to be a rap, star<br>
            Make papes, hit skins, drive a fat car<br>

            Now I suppose I'm the bad guy, why?<br>

            Good thoughts I wait, cause they hate my black tape<br>
            Yeah, it's on, and it's packed in the rap race<br>
            But if ya got a black face, it's a rat race<br>

        <h2>Keep Ya Head Up</h2><br>
        <p>Little something for my godson Elijah<br>
            And a little girl named Corin<br>
            <br>
            Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice<br>
            I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots<br>
            I give a holla to my sisters on welfare<br>
            2Pac cares if don't nobody else care<br>
            And I know they like to beat you down a lot<br>
            When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot<br>
            But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up<br>
            Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep your head up<br>
            And when he tells you you ain't nothing, don't believe him<br>
            And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him<br>
            'Cause, sister, you don't need him<br>
            And I ain't trying to gas ya up, I just call 'em how I see 'em<br>
            You know what makes me unhappy? When brothers make babies and leave a young mother to be a pappy<br>
            And since we all came from a woman<br>
            Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman<br>
            I wonder why we take from our women<br>
            Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?<br>
            I think it's time to kill for our women<br>
            Time to heal our women, be real to our women<br>
            And if we don't we'll have a race of babies<br>
            That will hate the ladies that make the babies<br>
            And since a man can't make one<br>
            He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one<br>
            So will the real men get up?<br>
            I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep your head up<br>
            <br>
            Keep ya head up, ooh, child<br>
            Things are gonna get easier<br>
            Keep ya head up, ooh, child<br>
            Things'll get brighter<br>
            Keep ya head up, ooh, child<br>
            Things are gonna get easier<br>
            Keep ya head up, ooh, child<br>
            Things'll get brighter<br>
            <br>
            Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me<br>
            He had me feeling like black was the thing to be<br>
            And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough<br>
            And though we had it rough, we always had enough<br>
            I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules<br>
            Ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two<br>
            And I realize momma really paid the price<br>
            She nearly gave her life to raise me right<br>
            And all I had to give her was my pipe dream<br>
            Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen<br>
            I'm trying to make a dollar out of fifteen cents<br>
            It's hard to be legit and still pay the rent<br>
            And in the end it seems I'm heading for the pen<br>
            I try to find my friends, but they're blowing in the wind<br>
            Last night my buddy lost his whole family<br>
            It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity<br>
            It seems the rain'll never let up<br>
            I try to keep my head up and still keep from getting wet up<br>
            You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours<br>
            They got money for wars but can't feed the poor<br>
            Say there ain't no hope for the youth<br>
            And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future<br>
            And then they wonder why we crazy<br>
            I blame my mother for turning my brother into a crack baby<br>
            We ain't meant to survive, 'cause it's a set-up<br>
            And even though you're fed up<br>
            Huh, you got to keep your head up<br>
            <br>
            Keep ya head up, ooh, child<br>
            Things are gonna get easier<br>
            Keep ya head up, ooh, child<br>
            Things'll get brighter<br>
            Keep ya head up, ooh, child<br>
            Things are gonna get easier<br>
            Keep ya head up, ooh, child<br>
            Things'll get brighter<br>
            <br>
            And uh, to all the ladies having babies on they own<br>
            I know it's kinda rough and you're feeling all alone<br>
            Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome<br>
            Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em<br>
            'Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure<br>
            And if you fall, stand tall and comeback for more<br>
            'Cause ain't nothing worse than when your son<br>
            Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'<br>
            You can't complain you was dealt this<br>
            Hell of a hand without a man, feeling helpless<br>
            Because there's too many things for you to deal with<br>
            Dying inside, but outside you're looking fearless<br>
            While tears is rolling down your cheeks<br>
            You steady hoping things don't fall down this week<br>
            'Cause if it did, you couldn't take it<br>
            And don't blame me, I was given this world, I didn't make it<br>
            And now my son's getting older and older and colder<br>
            From having the world on his shoulders<br>
            While the rich kids is driving Benz<br>
            I'm still trying to hold on to surviving friends<br>
            And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up<br>
            But please, you got to keep your head up</p>

        <h2>Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...</h2><br>
        <p><i>[2Pac speaking: ]</i><br>
            Yo, law!<br>
            Is it cool if a nigga just get fucked up for this one?<br>
            Yeah! Mr. Fuck-a-Cop is back<br>
            And I still don't give a fuck, yaknahmsayin'?<br>
            Puffin' on this indo<br>
            In the studio with my partners out here<br>
            Pacific Heights in the house, know what I mean<br>
            <br>
            I was framed, so don't make the same mistake, nigga<br>
            You gotta learn how to shake the snakes, nigga<br>
            Cause the police love to break a nigga<br>
            Send 'em upstate cause they straight-up hate the niggas<br>
            So what I do is get a crew of zoo niggas<br>
            Straight fools into rules and do niggas<br>
            And one-time had enough of me<br>
            I'm still raw so the law can't fuck with me<br>
            They wanna send me to the pen, punk, picture that<br>
            I stay strapped, motherfuckers better get your gat<br>
            It ain't easy bein' me, I can't take it<br>
            Life as a celebrity ain't everything they make it<br>
            And ever since the movies these hoes try to do me<br>
            If they can't screw me, they find a way to sue me<br>
            Now can you picture me coolin' at a night club?<br>
            Nothin' but love, but motherfuckers wanna mean mug<br>
            Since I wear a lot of gold, they plot<br>
            Don't know what I got and get shot with the hot ones<br>
            And, aw yeah, I wanna feel guilty<br>
            But you punk motherfuckers tried to milk me<br>
            You'll get smacked behind the hill with my phone on my pager<br>
            It's beepin' while I cut you with my razor<br>
            I'm not violent, I'm petrified and nervous<br>
            I got no mercy for these niggas tryin' to serve us<br>
            But if you catch me outta pocket, then I'm got<br>
            You love to shoot a nigga but you scared to pop a cop<br>
            Now drop it<br>
            <br>
            Strictly for my - strictly for my - strictly for my niggas <i>[3x]</i><br>
            <br>
            Strictly for my niggas, makin' G's<br>
            <br>
            Reflected and disrespected, plus I'm rejected<br>
            You're just another rapper, who swears he's makin' records<br>
            That's what they said - whenever I would walk by<br>
            I never tripped though - always kept my head up high<br>
            Eventually I knew, that I would find my way<br>
            After the darkest night always comes a brighter day<br>
            And some would say, that turned away is all you'll get<br>
            I just said "Bet!," and never let 'em see me sweat<br>
            Cause in the end, I knew that I would have it all<br>
            While non-believers were prayin' for my downfall<br>
            And some would call and tell me that they wish me well<br>
            But in my heart, I'm knowin' that they wish me hell<br>
            Yo, get a real job, rappin' doesn't pay the rent<br>
            I hit the studio, cause that's where all my money went<br>
            Never surrender, it's all about the faith you've got<br>
            Don't ever stop, just push it til you hit the top<br>
            And if you drop, at least you know you gave your all<br>
            Be true to you, and that way you can never fall<br>
            But beware, these backstabbers ain't no joke<br>
            Just like a rope, they hang on you until you're broke<br>
            And when you're broke, they move onto the next dope<br>
            And there you are, can't even pay your car, nope<br>
            And when you reminisce, thinkin' how you got dissed<br>
            Remember how it felt and then remember this<br>
            Be true to you, believe that there's no one bigger<br>
            Cause they can all suck dick - it's strictly for my niggas<br>
            <br>
            Strictly for my - strictly for my - strictly for my niggas <i>[3x]</i><br>
            <br>
            This is for the critics if you live up<br>
            Pick up my shit or I'll be back doin' stick-ups<br>
            I better see five stars next to my picture<br>
            If not, 2Pac will cop the Glock and come knockin' to get 'cha<br>
            I told you once, motherfucker, I'm a nut<br>
            Play me like a butt and you'll be bleedin' when you're fucked<br>
            Niggas know what's up but they be tryin' to hold me down<br>
            I'm comin' outta Oaktown, bitch fuck around<br>
            And it ain't where you from that makes you hardcore<br>
            Nigga it's the way you throw them thangs in the war<br>
            And to the marks that be talkin' all that shit<br>
            Screamin' out the next nigga's name like a bitch<br>
            And the niggas that I ran into recently<br>
            The motherfuckers at the club that pulled the piece on me<br>
            You little bitches shoulda pulled the fuckin' trigga<br>
            Now you live in fear of a heartless-ass nigga<br>
            Mr. Troublesome; niggas tried to play me with the gat<br>
            But like Terminator, nigga, I'll be back<br>
            Yeah! And I'll be back with a fuckin' army<br>
            You tried to harm me - ring the alarm, G<br>
            Cause most motherfuckers love to act up<br>
            Without they backup<br>
            When they get jacked up they crack up<br>
            It's strictly for my niggas at the show<br>
            So they know, not to play me like a ho<br>
            Strictly for my...<br>

        <p>Growing up as an inner city brotha<br>
            Where every other had a pops and a motha<br>
            I was the product of a heated lover.<br>
            Nobody knew how deep it screwed me<br>
            And since my pops never knew me<br>
            My family didn't know what to do with me.<br>
            Was I somebody they despised?<br>
            Curious look in they eyes<br>
            As if they wonder if I'm dead or alive<br>
            And poor momma can't control me<br>
            "Quit tryin' to save my soul, I wanna roll with my homies!"<br>
            A ticken timebomb, can't nobody fade me<br>
            Packin' a 380 and fiendin' for Mercedes<br>
            Suckers scatter but it don't matter I'm a cool shot<br>
            Punks drop from all the buckshots the fools got<br>
            I'm tired of being a nice guy<br>
            I've been poor all my life, but don't know quite why<br>
            So they label me a lunatic <br>
            Could care less death or success<br>
            Is what I quest 'cause I'm fearless<br>

            Much too young to bite the bullet<br>
            Hand on the trigga<br>
            I see my life before my eyes each time I pull it<br>
            I hope I live to be a man<br>
            Must be part of some big plan to keep a brotha in the state pen<br>
            Counting pennys over the years I'd done stacked many<br>

            Now they gotta cope<br>

            Henessey makes me think my enemy is getting close<br>
            BOOM BOOM BOOM <br>
            Got me shooting at a ghost<br>
            Some call me crazy but this is what you gave me<br>

            The things I wouldn't do to see a piece of family unity<br>
            Moms always work, I barely see her<br>
            I'm startin to get worried without a pops I'll grow to be her<br>
            It's a wonder they don't understand kids today<br>
            So when I pray, I pray I'll never grow to be that way<br>
            And I hope that he answers me<br>
            I heard God don't like ugly well take a look at my family<br>
            A different father every weekend<br>
            Before we get to meet him they break up before the week ends<br>
            I'm gettin sick of all the friendships<br>
            As soon as we kick it he done split and the whole shit ends quick<br>
            How can I be a man if there's no role model?<br>
            Strivin to save my soul I stay cold drinkin a forty bottle<br>
            I'm so sorry...<br>
            <br>
            I'm so sorry<br>
            For all this time (I'm so sorry)<br>
            For all this time<br>
            For all this time (don't lie)<br>
            I'm so sorry<br>
            For all this time (so, sorry)<br>
            For all this time<br>
            For all this time, so sorry baby!<br>

            Moms had to entertain many men;<br>
            Didn't wanna do it but it's time to pay the rent again.<br>
            I'm gettin a bit older and I'm startin to be a bother;<br>
            Moms can't stand me cause I'm lookin like my father<br>
            Should I stay or run away? Tell me the answer<br>
            Moms ignores me and avoids me like cancer<br>
            Grow up rough and it's hard to understand stuff<br>
            Moms was tough cause his papa wasn't man enough;<br>
            Couldn't stand up to his own responsibilities<br>
            Instead of takin care of me, he'd rather live lavishly<br>
            That's why I'll never be a father;<br>
            Unless you got the time it's a crime; don't even bother<br>
            (That's when I started hatin' the phony smiles<br>
            Said I was an only child)<br>
            Look at mama's lonely smile!<br>
            It's hard for a son to see his mother cry<br>
            She only loves you, but has to fuck with these other guys<br>
            I'm so sorry...<br>
            <br>
            I'm so sorry<br>
            For all this time (I'm so sorry)<br>
            For all this time<br>
            For all this time (don't lie)<br>
            I'm so sorry<br>
            For all this time (so, sorry)<br>
            For all this time<br>
            For all this time, so sorry baby!<br>

            Man child in the promised land couldn't afford many heroes<br>
            Moms was the only one there my pops was a no-show<br>
            And ohh -I guess ya didn't know <br>
            That I would grow to be so strong<br>
            Lookin kinda pale, was it the ale or pops was wrong?<br>
            Where was the money that you said, you would send me<br>
            Talked on the phone and you sounded so friendly<br>
            Ask about school and my welfare<br>
            But it's clear, you ain't sincere hey who the hell cares<br>
            You think I'm blind but this time I see you comin, Jack!<br>
            You grabbed your coat, left us broke, now ain't no runnin back<br>
            Ask about my moms like you loved her from the start<br>
            Left her in the dark, she fell apart from a broken heart<br>
            So don't even start with that "Born to be a father" shit<br>
            Don't even bother with your dollars I don't need it<br>
            I'll bury moms like you left me: all alone, G<br>
            Now that I finally found you, stay the fuck away from me<br>
            You're so sorry<br>
            <br>
            I'm so sorry<br>
            For all this time (I'm so sorry)<br>
            For all this time<br>
            For all this time (don't lie)<br>
            I'm so sorry<br>
            For all this time (so, sorry)<br>
            For all this time<br>
            For all this time, so sorry baby!<br>

            <i>[2Pac impersonating his father:]</i><br>
            I never meant to leave but I was wanted<br>
            Crossed too many people every house I'd touch was haunted<br>
            Had to watch the strangers every brother was a danger;<br>
            If I wanted to to keep you breathin, had to be out of range-a<br>
            Had to move on, done lost my name and picked a number<br>
            Made me watch my back I had no happy home to run to<br>
            Maybe it's my fault for being a father livin fast<br>
            But livin slow, mean half the dough, and you won't get no ass<br>
            Hindsight shows me it was wrong all along<br>
            I wanted to make some dough so you would grow to be so strong<br>
            It took a little longer than I thought<br>
            I slipped, got caught, and sent to jail by the courts<br>
            Now I'm doin time and I wish you'd understand<br>
            All I ever wanted was for you to be a man<br>
            And grow to be the titan you was meant to be<br>
            Keep the war fightin by the writings that you sent to me<br>
            I'm so sorry...<br>
            <br>
            I'm so sorry<br>
            For all this time (I'm so sorry)<br>
            For all this time<br>

            I'm so sorry<br>
            For all this time (so, sorry)<br>
