                            You know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion<br>
                            Happiness, living on the streets is a delusion<br>
                            Even a smooth criminal one day must get caught<br>
                            Shot up or shot down with the bullet that he bought<br>
                            Nine-millimeter kickin' thinkin' about what the streets do to me<br>
                            'Cause they never taught peace in the black community<br>
                            All we know is violence, do the job in silence<br>
                            Walk the city streets like a rat pack of tyrants<br>

                            Gettin' drunk, throwin' up, cuffed up, then I said I had enough<br>
                            There must be another route, way out to money and fame<br>
                            I changed my name, played a different game<br>

                            If one more cop harrasses me I just might go psycho<br>
                            And when I get 'em, I'll hit 'em with the bum rush<br>
                            Only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed<br>

                            My momma's on the shit, my daddy split and mom is steady blaming me<br>
                            Is it my fault just 'cause I'm a young black male?<br>
                            Cops sweat me as if my destiny is makin' crack sales<br>
                            Only fifteen and got problems<br>
                            Cops on my tail, so I bail 'til I dodge 'em<br>

                            "Remember Rodney King?" and I blast on his punk ass<br>
                            Now I got a murder case...<br>

                            I got me a Glock, and a Glock for the niggas on my block<br>
                            Momma tried to stab me, I moved out<br>
                            Sold a pound a weed, made G's, bought a new house<br>

"Yo this scene, rollers tried to jack a nigga 'cause a nigga with a pearl rollin' on a Coupé with goldens."<br>
"Yo man, what's up, this riding motherfucker<br>
Jack me at rollin' 'round bumping<br>
'Cause music's too loud, you know what I'm sayin'?"<br>
"Yo this P-O to the G-O<br>
Motherfucking cop just jacked me 'cause I was drinking beer in Mill Valley."<br>
"What's up, man?"<br>
"Aight, man, fuck 'em."<br>
<br>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
I don't give a fuck<br>
They done pushed me to my limit, I'm all in<br>
I might blow up any minute, did it again<br>
And now I'm in the back of the paddy wagon<br>
While this cop's bragging about the nigga he's jackin'<br>
I see no justice, all I see is niggas dying fast<br>
The sound of a gun blast, then watch the hearse pass<br>
Just another day in the life, G<br>
Gotta step lightly, 'cause cops tried to snipe me<br>
The cabs, they don't wanna stop for a brother, man<br>
But damn near have an accident to pick up another man<br>
I went to the bank to cash my check <br>
I get more respect from the mothafucking dope man<br>
The Grammy's and American Music shows<br>
They pimp us like hoes, take our dough, but they hate us though<br>
You better keep your mind on the real shit<br>
And fuck trying to get with these crooked-ass hypocrites<br>
The way they see it, we was meant to be kept down<br>
Just can't understand why we getting respect now<br>
Mama told me there'd be days like this<br>
But I'm pissed, 'cause it stays like this<br>
And now they're trying to ship me off to Kuwait?<br>
Give me a break. How much shit can a nigga take?<br>
I ain't going nowhere no how<br>
Bush wanna throw down?<br>
Better bring the gun, pal<br>
'Cause this is the day we make 'em pay<br>
Fuck bailing hay, I better spray with an AK<br>
And even if they shoot me down<br>
There'll be another nigga bigger from the mothafuckin' underground<br>
So step but you better step quick<br>
'Cause the clock's going tick and I'm sick of the bullshit<br>
You're watching the makings of a psychopath<br>
But you sit and laugh before the wrath and aftermath<br>
Who's that behind the trigger?<br>
Who do you think? A mothafucking 90's nigga<br>
Ready to buck and rip shit up, I had enough!<br>
Yeah, and i just don't give a fuck<br>
<br>
<i>[Pogo:]</i><br>
Nigga, it ain't just the blacks<br>
It's also a gang of motherfuckers dressed in blue slacks<br>
They say niggas hang in packs and they attitudes is shitty<br>
So tell me, who's the biggest gang of niggas in the city?<br>
They say we niggas like to do niggas<br>
So me an' a cop are just two niggas<br>
A street-walking nigga and a beat-walking nigga<br>
With a badge, I end his future and his past<br>
With a blast take his cash before I dash I bash his head in<br>
Dump him at the dead end and that's just his luck<br>
'Cause a nigga like P, don't really give a fuck<br>
<br>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
Walked in the store, what's everybody staring at?<br>
They act like they never seen a motherfucker wearing black<br>
Following a nigga and shit – ain't this a bitch?<br>
All I wanted was some chips<br>
I wanna take my business elsewhere – but where?<br>
'Cause who in the hell cares<br>
About a black man with a black need?<br>
They wanna jack me like some kind of crack fiend<br>
I wonder if he knows that my income<br>
Is more than his pension, salary and then some<br>
Your daughter is my number one fan<br>
And your trife-ass wife wants a life with a black man<br>
So who's the mack, in fact who's the black Jack?<br>
Sit back and get fat off the fat cat<br>
While he thinks that he's getting over<br>
I bust a move as smooth as Casanova<br>
And count another quick mill'<br>
I'm getting paid for my trade but I'm still real<br>
And if you look between the lines you'll find a rhyme<br>
As strong as a fucking nine<br>
Mail stacked up, niggas wanna act up<br>
Let's put the gats up and throw your blacks up<br>
But the cops getting dropped by the gun shot<br>
Used to come but he's done, now we run the block<br>
To my brothers — stay strong, keep your heads up<br>
They know we fed up; but they just don't give a fuck<br>
<br>
They just don't give a fuck<br>
<br>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
I gotta give my fuck offs<br>
Fuck you to the San Francisco police department<br>
Fuck you to the Marin County Sheriff's Department<br>
Fuck you to the FBI<br>
Fuck you to the CIA<br>
Fuck you to the B-u-s-h<br>
Fuck you to the Ameri-K-K-Ka<br>
Fuck you to all you redneck prejudice motherfuckers<br>
That wanna fuck with me, fuck y'all!<br>

                <br>
                The cops can't stand me, but they can't touch me<br>
                Call me a dope man, 'cause I rock dope beats<br>
                Jacked by the police, didn't have my ID<br>
                I said, "Excuse me, why you tryin' to rob me?"<br>
                He had the nerve to say that I had a curfew<br>
                ("Do you know what time it is?<br>
                Get out the fucking car, or I'll hurt you!")<br>
                Get out the car - or I'll hurt you<br>
                So here I go, I better make my mind up<br>
                Pick my nine up or hit the line-up<br>
                I chose B, stepped into the streets<br>
                The first cop grabbed me, the other ripped my seat<br>
                They grabbed my homie and they threw him to the concrete<br>
                (Ay man... Aiyyo... Ay man, just c'mon?)<br>
                ("What you doing, man?")<br>
                They tried to frame me<br>
                They tried to say I had some dope in the back seat<br>
                But I'm a rap fiend, not a crack fiend<br>
                My homie panicked ("I'm out!") he tried to run <br>
                (Freeze, nigga!) I heard a bullet fire from the cop's gun<br>
                My homie dropped, so I hit the cop<br>
                I kept swingin', yo, I couldn't stop<br>
                Before I knew it, I was beatin' the cop senseless<br>
                The other cop dropped his gun, he was defenseless<br>
                (Argh, fuck you! Ungh!)<br>
                Now I'm against this cop who was racist<br>
                Givin' him a taste of trading places<br>
                And all this 'cause the peckerwood was tryin' this frame up,<br>
                But I came up<br>
                Now they claimin' that I'm violent<br>
                <br>
                "They claimin' that I'm violent."<br>
                "Fuck the damn cop!"<br>
                "Just because we play what the people want."<br>
                <i>[3x]</i><br>
                <br>
                As I was beatin' on a cop, I heard a gun click (uh-oh)<br>
                Then the gun shot, but I wasn't hit<br>
                I turned around it was my homie with the gun in hand<br>
                He shot the cop (damn!). Now he's a dead man<br>
                I said, come on, it's time for us to get away<br>
                (Let's go, we gotta get the fuck outta here.)<br>
                They called for backup, and they'll be on their way<br>
                Jumped in the car and tried to get away quick<br>
                The car wouldn't start (damn!). We in deep shit<br>
                So we jumped out (C'mon, let's take the cop's car)<br>
                We drove a little ways thinkin' that we got far<br>
                But I looked up and all I saw was blue lights<br>
                (that's a lotta of one time)<br>
                If I die tonight, I'm dying in a gunfight<br>
                I grabbed the AK, my homie took the 12 gauge<br>
                (yeah, it's on now)<br>
                Load 'em up quick, it's time for us to spray<br>
                We'll shoot 'em up with they own fuckin' weapons<br>
                And when we through sprayin' then we steppin'<br>
                This is a lesson to the rednecks and crooked cops<br>
                You fuck with real niggas, get ya fuckin' ass dropped<br>
                So here we go, the police against us<br>
                Dark as dusk, waitin' for the guns to bust<br>
                (What's next, man?) What's next? I don't know and I don't care<br>
                One thing fo' sho', tommorrow I won't be here<br>
                But if I go, I'm takin' all these punks with me<br>
                (Pass me a clip) Pass me a clip, G, now come and get me<br>
                You wanna sweat me, never get me to be silent<br>
                Givin' them a reason to claim that I'm violent<br>
                <br>
                "They claimin' that I'm violent."<br>
                "Fuck the damn cop!"<br>
                "Just because we play what the people want."<br>

            <h2>Words of Wisdom</h2><br>
            <p>Killing us one by one<br>
                In one way or another<br>
                America will find a way to eliminate the problem<br>
                One by one<br>
                The problem is the troublesome black youth of the ghetto's<br>
                And one by one<br>
                We are being wiped off the face of this earth<br>
                At an extremely alarming rate<br>
                And even more alarming is the fact<br>
                That we are not fighting back<br>
                Brothers, sisters, niggas<br>
                When I say "nigga" it is not the nigga we have grown to fear<br>
                It is not the nigga we say as if it has no meaning<br>
                But to me it means Never Ignorant Getting Goals Accomplished, nigga<br>
                Niggas, what are we going to do?<br>
                Walk blind into a line or fight<br>
                Fight and die if we must die, like niggas<br>
                <br>
                This is for the masses, the lower classes<br>
                The ones you left out, jobs were giving, better living<br>
                But we were kept out<br>
                Made to feel inferior, but we're superior<br>
                Break the chains in our brains that made us fear ya<br>
                Pledge allegiance to a flag that neglects us<br>
                Honour a man that refuses to respect us<br>
                Emancipation Proclamation? Please!<br>
                Lincoln just said that to save the nation<br>
                These are lies that we all accepted<br>
                Say no to drugs but the governments' kept it<br>
                Running through our community, killing the unity<br>
                The war on drugs is a war on you and me<br>
                And yet, they say this is the Home of The Free<br>
                But if you ask me, it's all about hypocrisy<br>
                The constitution, Yo, it don't apply to me<br>
                And Lady Liberty? Stupid bitch lied to me<br>
                This made me strong, and no one's gonna like what I'm pumpin'<br>
                But it's wrong to keep someone from learning something<br>
                So get up, it's time to start nation building<br>
                I'm fed up, we gotta start teach the children<br>
                That they can be all that they want to be<br>
                There's much more to life than just poverty<br>
                <br>
                This is definitely uh... words of wisdom<br>
                AMERICA! AMERICA! AMERIK-K-KA<br>
                I charge you with the crime of rape, murder, and assault<br>
                For suppressing and punishing my people<br>
                I charge you with robbery for robbing me of my history<br>
                I charge you with false imprisonment for keeping me<br>
                Trapped in the projects<br>
                And the jury finds you guilty on all accounts<br>
                And you are to serve the consequences of your evil schemes<br>
                Prosecutor, do you have any more evidence?<br>
                <br>
                Words of Wisdom<br>
                Based upon the strength of a nation<br>
                Conquer the enemy armed with education<br>
                Protect yourself, reach for what you want to do<br>
                Know thyself, teach by what we've been through<br>
                Armed with the knowledge of the place we've been<br>
                No one will ever oppress this race again<br>
                No Malcolm X in my history text, why's that?<br>
                'Cause he tried to educate and liberate all blacks<br>
                Why is Martin Luther King in my book each week?<br>
                He told blacks, if they get smacked, turn the other cheek<br>
                I don't get it, so many questions went through my mind<br>
                I get sweated, they act like asking questions is a crime<br>
                But forget it, cause one day I'm gonna prove them wrong<br>
                Not every brother had his mother on the welfare line<br>
                The American Dream, though it seems like it's attainable<br>
                They're pulling your sleeve, don't believe<br>
                'Cause it will strangle ya<br>
                Pulling the life of your brain, I can't explain<br>
                Beg as you can obtain from which you came<br>
                Swear that your mother is living in equality<br>
                Forgetting your brother that's living in poverty<br>
                Thought they had us beaten when they took out King<br>
                But the battle ain't over till the black man sings<br>
                Words of Wisdom<br>
                The battle ain't over 'till the black man sings<br>

                NIGHTMARE! That's what I am<br>
                America's nightmare<br>
                I am what you made me<br>
                The hate and the evil that you gave me<br>
                I shine as a reminder of what you've done to my people<br>
                For Four hundred plus years<br>
                You should be scared<br>
                You should be running<br>
                You should be trying to silence me<br>
                Ha, but you cannot escape fate<br>
                For it is my turn to come<br>
                Just as you rose you will fall<br>
                By my hands<br>
                America, you reap what you sow<br>

            <h2>If My Homie Calls</h2><br>
            <p>Ever since you was a pee-wee, down by my knee with a wee-wee<br>
                We been coochie-coo all through school, you and me, G<br>
                Back in the days we played practical jokes on<br>
                Everybody smoked with they locs and they yokes on<br>
                All through high school, girls by the dozens<br>
                Saying we cousins, knowing that we wasn't<br>
                But like the old saying goes<br>
                Times goes on, and everybody grows<br>
                Grew apart, had to part, went our own ways<br>
                You chose the dope game, my microphone pays<br>
                In many ways we were paid in the old days<br>
                So far away from the crazies with AK's<br>
                And though I been around clowning with the Underground<br>
                I'm still down with my homies from the hometown<br>
                And if you need, need anything at all<br>
                I drop it all for y'all, if my homies call<br>
                <br>
                "If you ever need a place to stay"<br>
                "Well, alright, y'all"<br>
                "Brothers and sisters"<br>
                <br>
                It's a shame, you chose the dope game<br>
                Now you slang 'caine on the streets with no name<br>
                It was plain that your aim was mo' 'caine<br>
                You got game now you run with no shame<br>
                I chose rapping tracks to make stacks<br>
                In fact I travel the map with raps that spray cats<br>
                But now I don't wanna down my homie<br>
                No matter how low you go, you're not lowly<br>
                And I, hear that you made a few enemies<br>
                But when you need a friend you can depend on me, call<br>
                If you need my assistance, there'll be no resistance<br>
                I'll be there in an instant<br>
                Who am I to judge another brother, only on his cover<br>
                I'd be no different than the other<br>
                H-to-the-O-to-the-M-to-the-I-to-the-E<br>
                I'm down to the E-N-D<br>
                'Cause it's a fall in no time at all<br>
                I'm down for y'all, when my homies call<br>
                Word, if my homies call<br>
                <br>
                "If you ever need a place to stay"<br>
                "Well, alright, y'all"<br>
                "Brothers and sisters"<br>
                <br>
                Well, it's ninety-one and I'm living kinda swell now<br>
                But I hear that you're going through some hell, pal<br>
                But life making records ain't easy<br>
                It ain't what I expected, it's hectic, it's sleazy<br>
                But I guess that the streets is harder<br>
                Trying to survive in the life of a young godfather<br>
                My homies is making it elsewhere<br>
                Striving, working nine to five with no health care<br>
                We both had dreams of being great<br>
                But his deferred and blurred and changed in shape<br>
                It's fate, it wasn't my choice to make<br>
                To be great, I'm giving it all it takes<br>
                Trying to shake, the crates and fakes and snakes<br>
                I gotta take my place or fall from grace<br>
                The foolish way, the pace is quick and great<br>
                Smiling face to hide the trace of hate<br>
                But my homie would never do me wrong<br>
                That's why I wrote this song, if you ever need me, it's on<br>
                No matter who the foe they must fall<br>
                Us against them all I'm down to brawl if my homies call<br>
                <br>
                "If you ever need a place to stay"<br>
                "Well, alright, y'all"<br>

            <h2>Brenda's Got a Baby</h2><br>
            <p><i>[Dave Hollister:]</i><br>
                Brenda's got a baby<br>
                <br>
                <i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
                I hear Brenda's got a baby<br>
                But Brenda's barely got a brain<br>
                A damn shame, the girl can hardly spell her name<br>
                That's not our problem, that's up to Brenda's family<br>
                Well let me show you how it affects our whole community<br>
                Now Brenda really never knew her moms<br>
                And her dad was a junkie putting death into his arms<br>
                It's sad, cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know<br>
                Just cause you're in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow<br>
                But oh, that's a thought, my own revelation<br>
                Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation<br>
                Brenda got herself a boyfriend<br>
                Her boyfriend was her cousin, now let's watch the joy end<br>
                She tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family<br>
                Who really didn't care to see, or give a damn if she<br>
                Went out and had a church of kids<br>
                As long as when the check came they got first dibs<br>
                Now Brenda's belly's getting bigger<br>
                But no one seems to notice any change in her figure<br>
                She's twelve years old and she's having a baby<br>
                In love with a molester, who's sexing her crazy<br>
                And yet and she thinks that he'll be with her forever<br>
                And dreams of a world where the two of them are together, whatever<br>
                He left her and she had the baby solo<br>
                She had it on the bathroom floor and didn't know so<br>
                She didn't know, what to throw away and what to keep<br>
                She wrapped the baby up and threw him in a trash heap<br>
                I guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the cries<br>
                She didn't realize how much the little baby had her eyes<br>
                Now the baby's in the trash heap bawling<br>
                Momma can't help her, but it hurts to hear her calling<br>
                Brenda wants to run away<br>
                Momma say, you making me lose pay<br>
                There's social workers here every day<br>
                Now Brenda's gotta make her own way<br>
                Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay<br>
                No money no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job<br>
                She tried to sell crack but end up getting robbed<br>
                So now what's next, there ain't nothing left to sell<br>
                So she sees sex as a way of leaving hell<br>
                It's paying the rent, so she really can't complain<br>
                Prostitute, found slain and Brenda's her name, she's got a baby</p>

            <h2>Rebel of the Underground</h2><br>
            <p>Rebel... rebel<br>
                Rebel<br>
                Rebel... rebel<br>
                <br>
                They just can't stand the reign, or the occasional pain<br>
                From a man like me, who goes against the grain<br>
                Sometimes I do it in vain<br>
                So with a little bass and treble<br>
                Hey mister, it's time for me to explain that I'm the rebel<br>
                Cold as the devil<br>
                Straight from the underground, the rebel, a lower level<br>
                They came to see the maniac psychopath<br>
                The critics heard of me, and the aftermath<br>
                I don't give a damn and it shows<br>
                And when I do a stage show I wear street clothes<br>
                So they all know me<br>
                The lyrical lunatic, the maniac MC<br>
                I give a shout out to your homies<br>
                And maybe then, the critics'll leave your boy alone, G<br>
                On the streets or on TV<br>
                It just don't pay to be, a truth tellin' MC<br>
                They won't be happy 'til I'm banned<br>
                The most dangerous weapon: an educated black man<br>
                So point blank in your face<br>
                Pump up the bass, and join the human race<br>
                I throw peace to the Bay<br>
                Cause from The Jungle to Oaktown, they backin' me up all the way<br>
                You know you gotta love the sound<br>
                It's from the rebel - the rebel of the underground<br>
                <br>
                Rebel, he's a rebel<br>
                Rebel of the underground<br>
                <i>[4x]</i><br>
                <br>
                Now I'm face to face with the devils<br>
                Cause they breedin' more rebels than the whole damn ghetto<br>
                And police brutality<br>
                Shit, it put you in the nip and call it technicality<br>
                So you reap what you sow<br>
                So reap the wrath of the rebel, jackin' 'em up once mo'<br>
                Now the fox is in the henhouse<br>
                Creepin' up on your daughter while you sleep I got her sneakin' out<br>
                2Pac ain't nothin' nice, I'll be nothin' how I wanna<br>
                And doin' what I'm gonna<br>
                Now I'm up to no good<br>
                The mastermind of mischief movin' more than most could<br>
                So sit and slip into the sound<br>
                Peep the rebel - the rebel of the underground<br>
                <br>
                Rebel, he's a rebel<br>
                Rebel of the underground<br>
                <i>[4x]</i><br>
                <br>
                They say they hate me, they wanna hold me down<br>
                I guess they scared of the rebel - the rebel of the underground<br>
                But I never let it get me<br>
                I just make another record 'bout the punks tryin' to sweat me<br>
                In fact, they tryin' to keep me out<br>
                Try to censor what I say<br>
                Cause they don't like what I'm talkin' 'bout<br>
                So what's wrong with the media today<br>
                Got brothers sellin' out cause they greedy to get paid<br>
                But me, I'm comin' from the soul<br>
                And if it don't go gold, my story still gettin' told<br>
                And that way they can't stop me<br>
                And if it sells a couple of copies, the punks'll try to copy<br>
                It's sloppy, don't even try to<br>
                I'm a slave to the rhythm, and I'm about to fly through<br>
                So, yo, to the people in the ghetto<br>
                When ya hear the bass flow, go ahead and let go<br>
                Now everybody wanna gangbang<br>
                They talkin' street slang, but the punks still can't hang<br>
                They makin' records 'bout violence<br>
                But when it comes to the real, some brothers go silent<br>
                It kinda make you wanna think about<br>
                That ya gotta do some sellin' out, just to get your record out<br>
                But 2Pacalypse is straight down<br>
                So feel the wrath of the rebel - the rebel of the underground<br>
                <br>
                2Pac is a rebel<br>

                This hypocritical world and the people in it<br>
                Now speakin' of, in it Cindi loved to get buckwild<br>
                Fuck with a smile single file she'll bust enough styles<br>

                I grew up in a home where no-one liked me<br>
                Moms would hit the pipe, every night, she would fight me<br>
                Poppa was a nasty old man, like the rest<br>
                He's feelin' on my chest, with his hand in my dress<br>
                Just another pest and yes I was nervous<br>
                Was this a test? I just don't deserve this<br>
                I wanna tell mom, but would she listen<br>
                She's bound to be bitchin' if she hasn't got a fix in, so<br>
                Now I lay me down to sleep, Lord don't let him rape me<br>
                If he does my soul to keep, don't let the devil take me<br>
                Can't concentrate I contemplate in my classroom<br>
                Thinkin' how my step dad raped me in the bathroom<br>
                Every day I make class and yet I'm missin' periods<br>
                The thought of pregnancy is in my head and now I'm fearin' it<br>
                I gotta tell mom before she sees me<br>
                I told her how he treated me and she didn't believe me<br>
                Callin' me a slut cause my butt's kinda big so<br>
                Still that ain't no way to be talkin' to your kids though<br>
                I can't believe the way he caught her<br>
                Got her believin' him and dissin' her own daughter<br>
                Time for me to break and find another<br>
