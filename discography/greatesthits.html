        <h2>Keep Ya Head Up</h2><br>
        <p>Little something for my godson Elijah<br>
            And a little girl named Corin<br>
            <br>
            Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice<br>
            I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots<br>
            I give a holla to my sisters on welfare<br>
            2Pac cares if don't nobody else care<br>
            And I know they like to beat you down a lot<br>
            When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot<br>
            But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up<br>
            Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep your head up<br>
            And when he tells you you ain't nothing, don't believe him<br>
            And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him<br>
            'Cause, sister, you don't need him<br>
            And I ain't trying to gas ya up, I just call 'em how I see 'em<br>
            You know what makes me unhappy? When brothers make babies and leave a young mother to be a pappy<br>
            And since we all came from a woman<br>
            Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman<br>
            I wonder why we take from our women<br>
            Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?<br>
            I think it's time to kill for our women<br>
            Time to heal our women, be real to our women<br>
            And if we don't we'll have a race of babies<br>
            That will hate the ladies that make the babies<br>
            And since a man can't make one<br>
            He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one<br>
            So will the real men get up?<br>
            I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep your head up<br>
            <br>
            Keep ya head up, ooh, child<br>
            Things are gonna get easier<br>
            Keep ya head up, ooh, child<br>
            Things'll get brighter<br>
            Keep ya head up, ooh, child<br>
            Things are gonna get easier<br>
            Keep ya head up, ooh, child<br>
            Things'll get brighter<br>
            <br>
            Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me<br>
            He had me feeling like black was the thing to be<br>
            And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough<br>
            And though we had it rough, we always had enough<br>
            I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules<br>
            Ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two<br>
            And I realize momma really paid the price<br>
            She nearly gave her life to raise me right<br>
            And all I had to give her was my pipe dream<br>
            Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen<br>
            I'm trying to make a dollar out of fifteen cents<br>
            It's hard to be legit and still pay the rent<br>
            And in the end it seems I'm heading for the pen<br>
            I try to find my friends, but they're blowing in the wind<br>
            Last night my buddy lost his whole family<br>
            It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity<br>
            It seems the rain'll never let up<br>
            I try to keep my head up and still keep from getting wet up<br>
            You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours<br>
            They got money for wars but can't feed the poor<br>
            Say there ain't no hope for the youth<br>
            And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future<br>
            And then they wonder why we crazy<br>
            I blame my mother for turning my brother into a crack baby<br>
            We ain't meant to survive, 'cause it's a set-up<br>
            And even though you're fed up<br>
            Huh, you got to keep your head up<br>
            <br>
            Keep ya head up, ooh, child<br>
            Things are gonna get easier<br>
            Keep ya head up, ooh, child<br>
            Things'll get brighter<br>
            Keep ya head up, ooh, child<br>
            Things are gonna get easier<br>
            Keep ya head up, ooh, child<br>
            Things'll get brighter<br>
            <br>
            And uh, to all the ladies having babies on they own<br>
            I know it's kinda rough and you're feeling all alone<br>
            Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome<br>
            Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em<br>
            'Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure<br>
            And if you fall, stand tall and comeback for more<br>
            'Cause ain't nothing worse than when your son<br>
            Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'<br>
            You can't complain you was dealt this<br>
            Hell of a hand without a man, feeling helpless<br>
            Because there's too many things for you to deal with<br>
            Dying inside, but outside you're looking fearless<br>
            While tears is rolling down your cheeks<br>
            You steady hoping things don't fall down this week<br>
            'Cause if it did, you couldn't take it<br>
            And don't blame me, I was given this world, I didn't make it<br>
            And now my son's getting older and older and colder<br>
            From having the world on his shoulders<br>
            While the rich kids is driving Benz<br>
            I'm still trying to hold on to surviving friends<br>
            And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up<br>
            But please, you got to keep your head up</p>

            I know you representin the crew<br>
            And I can picture you in heaven with a blunt and a brew<br>
            Fuck the world, pain was a part of the game<br>
            If you a baller, money went as quick as it came<br>
            My role models - gone or they locked in the pen<br>
            Straight hustlers, caught up in the whirlwind<br>
            The other day, I thought I seen my homeboy Biggy<br>
            Sayin shit don't stop nigga no pity<br>
            We all hoods, and all we ever had was dreams<br>
            Money makin' motherfuckers plot scandalous schemes<br>
            In the gutter, you learn to have a criminal mind<br>
            I was addicted to tryin, never meant to do time<br>
            My epitaph, will read, was the last of G's<br>
            Kicked the shit to make the white man bleed<br>

            Memories of my nigga but he dead now<br>
            Lookin back in my yearbook, all the years took<br>
            Half my peers, they're stretched for years<br>
            And if I die will they all shed tears?<br>
            Two to the dome, leave me alone, let me get my head clear<br>
            Paranoid got me lookin in the mirror<br>
            Behind me, life without my nine, I'd rather do the time<br>
            See I'm old enough to know that ain't no justice<br>
            Fuck the police and all the courts, same way they fucked us<br>
            And why the hell am I locked in jail<br>
            They let them white boys free, we be shocked as hell<br>
            In my mind I can see it comin<br>
            And all the time it's a plot to keep a nigga runnin<br>
            I keep a gun and never run unless I'm comin at ya<br>
            Cry later but for now let's enjoy the laughter<br>

            Stress in the city, the cops is on top of me<br>
            The projects is full of bullets, though bodies is droppin'<br>
            They ain't no stoppin' me<br>
            Constantly movin' while makin' millions<br>

            Maybe he'll listen in his casket; the aftermath<br>

            They're relocatin' to the cemetery<br>
            Got me runnin', stressin', my vision's blurry<br>
            The question is will I live? No one in the world loves me<br>
            I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers<br>
            Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feeling this anger<br>
            Don't wanna make excuses, cause this is how it is<br>

            Pictures of my birth on this earth is what I'm dreamin'<br>
            Seein' daddy's semen, full of crooked demons<br>
            Already crazy and screamin'<br>
            I guess them nightmares as a child<br>
            Had me scared, but left me prepared for a while<br>
            Is there another route? For a crooked outlaw<br>
            Veteran, a villain, a young thug, who one day shall fall<br>

            Scheme on the schemin' and leave they peeps grievin'<br>
            Cause ain't no bucks to stack up, my nuts is backed up<br>

            And evil's lurkin', I can see him smirkin' when I gets to pervin'<br>

            When will I finally get to rest through this oppression?<br>
            They punish the people that's askin' questions,<br>
            And those that possess steal from the ones without possessions<br>
            The message I stress: to make it stop, study your lessons<br>
            Don't settle for less, even the genius asks his questions<br>
            Be grateful for blessings, don't ever change, keep your essence<br>
            The power is in the people and politics we address<br>
            Always do your best, don't let the pressure make you panic<br>
            And when you get stranded<br>
            And things don't go the way you planned it<br>
            Dreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference<br>
            Politicians are hypocrites, they don't wanna listen<br>
            If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change<br>

        <h2>So Many Tears</h2><br>
        <p>I shall not fear no man but God<br>
            Though I walk through the valley of death<br>
            I shed so many tears<br>
            If I should die before I wake<br>
            Please God walk with me<br>
            Grab a nigga and take me to Heaven<br>
            <br>
            Back in elementary, I thrived on misery<br>
            Left me alone I grew up amongst a dying breed<br>
            Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest<br>
            Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest<br>
            Tell me can you feel me<br>
            I'm not living in the past, you wanna last?<br>
            Be the first to blast Remember Kato<br>
            No longer with us; he's deceased<br>
            Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets, now rest in peace<br>
            Is there heaven for a G? Remember me<br>
            So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears<br>
            <br>
            I! I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears...<br>
            Lord! I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears<br>
            <br>
            Now that I'm struggling in this business, by any means<br>
            Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen<br>
            And fuck the world cause I'm cursed, I'm having visions<br>
            Of leaving here in a hearse, God can you feel me?<br>
            Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain<br>
            Show me some happiness again, I'm going blind<br>
            I spend my time in this cell, ain't living well<br>
            I know my destiny is Hell. Where did I fail?<br>
            My life is in denial and when I die<br>
            Baptized in eternal fire, shed so many tears<br>
            <br>
            Lord! I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears...<br>
            Lord! I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears<br>
            <br>
            Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears<br>
            I'm suicidal so don't stand near me<br>
            My every move is a calculated step, to bring me closer<br>
            To embrace an early death, now there's nothing left<br>
            There was no mercy on the streets, I couldn't rest<br>
            I'm barely standing, bout to go to pieces, screamin' peace<br>
            And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it<br>
            I had my mind full of demons trying to break free<br>
            They planted seeds and they hatched, sparking the flame<br>
            Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game<br>
            No memories, just a misery<br>
            Painting a picture of my enemies killing me, in my sleep<br>
            Will I survive 'til the mornin' to see the sun<br>
            Please Lord forgive me for my sins, cause here I come<br>
            <br>
            Lord! (God!), I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears...<br>
            God! I lost so many peers<br>
            <br>
            And Lord knows I tried, been a witness to homicide<br>
            Seen drive-bys takin' lives, little kids die<br>
            Wonder why as I walk by<br>
            Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, getting high<br>
            This ain't the life for me, I wanna change<br>
            But ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game<br>
            I'm trapped inside a maze<br>
            See this Tanqueray influenced me to getting crazy<br>
            Disillusioned lately, I've been really wanting babies<br>
            So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady<br>
            Don't trust my lady cause she's a product of this poison<br>
            I'm hearing noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys, can't take no more<br>
            I'm fallin' to the floor; beggin' for the Lord to let me in<br>
            To Heaven's door -- shed so many tears<br>
            <br>
            Lord! lost so many peers, and shed so many tears...<br>
            I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears...<br>
            Lord! I suffered many years, and shed so many tears...<br>
            God! I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears</p>

            Witness the tears falling free from my eyes, before she could reply<br>
            Though we were born without a silver spoon<br>
            My broken down TV, show cartoons in my living room (hey)<br>
            One day I hope to make it, a player in this game<br>
            Mama don't cry, long as we try, maybe things change<br>
            Perhaps it's just a fantasy<br>
            A life where we don't need no welfare and share with our whole family<br>
            Maybe it's me that caused it, the fighting and the hurtin'<br>
            In my room crying cause I didn't want to be a burden<br>
            Watch mama open up her arms to hug me<br>
            And I ain't worried bout a damn thang, with unconditional love<br>

            Just got the message you've been calling all week<br>
            Been out here hustling on these streets, ain't had a chance to speak<br>
            But you know, with you and me it's on G<br>
            We could never be enemies<br>
            Cause you been such a good friend to me<br>
            Where would I be without my dogs<br>
            No wonder why when times get hard<br>
            Cause it ain't easy being who we are<br>
            Driven by my ambitions, desire higher positions<br>
            So I proceed to make Gs, eternally in my mission<br>
            Is to be more than just a rap musician<br>
            The elevation of today's generation, if I could make 'em listen<br>
            Prison ain't what we need, no longer stuck in greed<br>
            Time to plan, strategize, my family's gotta eat<br>
            When we make something out of nothing<br>
            No pleasure in the suffering, neighborhood would be good<br>
            If they could cut out all the busting<br>
            The liquor and the weed the cussing<br>
            Sending love out to my block<br>

            How come I never made it<br>
            Maybe it's the way I played it in my heart<br>

            My hopes and all my wishes<br>
            So many vivid pictures, and all the currency<br>
            I'll never even get to see<br>
            This fast life soon shatters<br>
            Cause after all the lights and screams<br>
            Nothing but my dreams matter<br>
            Hoping for better days<br>
            Maybe a peaceful night, baby don't cry<br>
            Cause everything gonna be alright<br>
            Just lay your head on my shoulder<br>
            Don't worry bout a thing, baby<br>

        <h2>Trapped</h2><br>
        <p>You know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion<br>
            Happiness, living on the streets is a delusion<br>
            Even a smooth criminal one day must get caught<br>
            Shot up or shot down with the bullet that he bought<br>
            Nine millimeter kickin' thinkin' about what the streets do to me<br>
            'Cause they never talk peace in the black community<br>
            All we know is violence, do the job in silence<br>
            Walk the city streets like a rat pack of tyrants<br>
            Too many brothers daily heading for the big pen<br>
            Niggas comin' out worse-off than when they went in<br>
            Over the years I done a lot of growin' up<br>
            Getting drunk, throwin' up<br>
            Cuffed up<br>
            Then I said I had enough<br>
            There must be another route, way out<br>
            To money and fame, I changed my name<br>
            And played a different game<br>
            Tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle<br>
            If one more cop harasses me I just might go psycho<br>
            And when I get 'em, I'll hit 'em with the bum rush<br>
            Only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed<br>
            Yo, if you're smart you'll really let me go, G<br>
            But keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch the Uzi<br>
            They got me trapped<br>
            <br>
            Uh, uh, they can't keep the black man down<br>
            They got me trapped<br>
            Naw, they can't keep the black man down<br>
            Trapped<br>
            Uh, uh, they can't keep the black man down<br>
            Trapped<br>
            Naw, they can't keep the black man down<br>
            <br>
            They got me trapped<br>
            Can barely walk the city streets<br>
            Without a cop harassing me, searching me<br>
            Then asking my identity<br>
            Hands up, throw me up against the wall<br>
            Didn't do a thing at all<br>
            I'm telling you one day these suckers gotta fall<br>
            Cuffed up throw me on the concrete<br>
            Coppers try to kill me<br>
            But they didn't know this was the wrong street<br>
            Bang, bang, count another casualty<br>
            But it's a cop who's shot for his brutality<br>
            Who do you blame? It's a shame because the man's slain<br>
            He got caught in the chains of his own game<br>
            How can I feel guilty after all the things they did to me?<br>
            Sweated me, hunted me<br>
            Trapped in my own community<br>
            One day I'm gonna bust<br>
            Blow up on this society<br>
            Why did ya lie to me?<br>
            I couldn't find a trace of equality<br>
            Work me like a slave while they laid back<br>
            Homie, don't play that<br>
            It's time I let 'em suffer the payback<br>
            I'm trying to avoid physical contact<br>
            I can't hold back, it's time to attack jack<br>
            They got me trapped<br>
            <br>
            Uh, uh, they can't keep the black man down<br>
            They got me trapped<br>

            Naw, they can't keep the black man down<br>
            <br>
            Now I'm trapped and want to find my getaway<br>
            All I need is a 'G' and somewhere safe to stay<br>
            Can't use the phone<br>
            'Cause I'm sure someone is tapping in<br>
            Did it before<br>
            Ain't scared to use my gat again<br>
            I look back in hindsight the fight was irrelevant<br>
            But now he's the devil's friend<br>
            Too late to be tellin' him<br>
            He shot first and I'll be damned if I run away<br>
            Homie is done away, I should've put my gun away<br>
            I wasn't thinking, all I heard was the ridicule<br>
            Girlies was laughin', Tup saying, "Damn homies is dissing you."<br>
            I fired my weapon<br>
            Started steppin' in the hurricane<br>
            I got shot so I dropped<br>
            Feelin' a burst of pain<br>
            Got to my feet<br>
            Couldn't see nothin' but bloody blood<br>
            Now I'm a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer<br>
            Ran through an alley<br>
            Still lookin' for my getaway<br>
            Coppers said, "Freeze, or you'll be dead today."<br>
            Trapped in a corner<br>
            Dark and I couldn't see the light<br>
            Thoughts in my mind was the nine and a better life<br>
            What do I do? Live my life in a prison cell?<br>
            I'd rather die than be trapped in a living hell<br>
            They got me trapped<br>

            Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a Heaven for a G<br>

            My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on<br>
            <br>
            As I bail through the empty halls, breath stinkin' in my jaws<br>
            Ring, ring, ring, quiet y'all, incoming call<br>
            Plus this my homie from high school, he's getting by<br>
            It's time to bury another brother, nobody cry<br>
            Life as a baller: alcohol and booty calls<br>
            We used to do them as adolescents, do you recall?<br>
            Raised as G's, loc'ed out and blazed the weed<br>
            Get on the roof, let's get smoked out and blaze with me<br>
            2 in the morning and we still high assed out<br>
            Screaming "thug till I die" before I passed out<br>
            But now that you're gone, I'm in the zone<br>
            Thinking I don't wanna die all alone, but now ya gone<br>
            And all I got left are stinkin' memories<br>
            I love them niggas to death, I'm drinkin' Hennessy<br>
            While trying to make it last<br>
            I drank a fifth for that ass when you passed<br>
            Cause life goes on<br>
            <br>
            How many brothers fell victim to the streets?<br>

            <br>
            Yeah nigga, I got the word is hell<br>
            Ya blew trial and the judge gave you 25 with an L<br>
            Time to prepare to do fed time, won't see parole<br>
            Imagine life as a convict that's getting old<br>
            Plus with the drama we're looking out for your baby's mama<br>
            Taken risks, while keeping cheap tricks from getting on her<br>
            Life in the hood is all good for nobody<br>
            Remember gaming on dumb hotties at yo' parties<br>
            Me and you, no truer two<br>
            While scheming on hits<br>
            And getting tricks that maybe we can slide into<br>
            But now you buried. Rest, nigga, cause I ain't worried<br>
            Eyes blurry saying goodbye at the cemetery<br>
            Though memories fade<br>
            I got your name tatted on my arm<br>
            So we both ball till my dying days<br>
            Before I say goodbye<br>
            Kato and Mental rest in peace. Thug till I die!<br>

            Bury me smiling with G's in my pocket<br>
            Have a party at my funeral, let every rapper rock it<br>
            Let the hoes that I used to know<br>
            From way before kiss me from my head to my toe<br>
            Give me a paper and a pen so I can write about my life of sin<br>
            A couple bottles of gin in case I don't get in<br>
            Tell all my people I'm a Ridah<br>
            Nobody cries when we die, we outlaws, let me ride<br>
            Until I get free, I live my life in the fast lane<br>
            Got police chasing me<br>
            To my niggas from old blocks, from old crews<br>
            Niggas that guided me through back in the old school<br>
            Pour out some liquor, have a toast for the homies<br>
            See, we both gotta die, but you chose to go before me<br>
            And brothers, miss ya while your gone<br>
            You left your nigga on his own. How long we mourn?<br>
            Life goes on<br>
            <br>
            How many brothers fell victim to the streets?<br>
            <br>
            Life goes on homie<br>
            Gone on, cause they passed away<br>
            Niggas doing life, niggas doing 50 and 60 years and shit<br>
            I feel ya, nigga. Trust me, I feel ya<br>
            You know what I mean<br>
            Last year we poured out liquor for ya<br>
            This year nigga, life goes on<br>
            We're gonna clock now<br>
            Get money, evade bitches, evade tricks, give playa haters plenty of space, and basically just represent for you baby<br>
            Next time you see your niggas, you're gonna be on top, nigga<br>
            They're gonna be like, "Goddamn, them niggas came up"<br>
            That's right, baby, life goes on and we up out this bitch<br>
            Hey Kato, Mental<br>
            Y'all niggas make sure it's poppin' when we get up there man<br>
            Don't front<br>
            Life goes on<br>

            Shit, them niggas that shot me is still terrified I'll get they ass<br>

            We troublesome<br>
            Y'all know what time it is<br>
            Call the punk police, they can't stop us<br>
            Niggas run the streets, we troubleshit<br>
            <br>
            Gutter ways, my mentality is ghetto<br>
            We guerrilla in this criminal war, we all rebels<br>
            Death before dishonor, bet I bomb on first<br>
            Niggas knew we came for murder, pullin' up in a hearse<br>
            Westside was the war cry, bustin' off freely<br>
            Screaming, "Fuck all ya'll niggas!" in Swahili<br>
            Pistol packin', fresh out of jail, I ain't goin' back<br>
            Release me to the care of my heartless strap<br>
            Say my name three times like Candyman<br>
            Bet I roll on yo' ass like an avalanche<br>
            A sole survivor, learned to get high and pull drive-by's<br>
            Murder my foes, can't control my 9<br>
            Hearin' thoughts of my enemies pleadin' please<br>
            Busta-ass motherfuckers tried to flee<br>
            Picture me lettin' this chump survive; ran up on his ass<br>
            When I dumped he died, 'cause I'm troublesome<br>

            Dead at thirteen 'cause he yearned to bang<br>
            Sent a lot of flowers, but how could I cry<br>
            Tried to warn the little nigga, "Either stop or die"<br>
            Mercy is for the weak, when I speak I scream<br>
            Afraid to sleep; I'm having crazy dreams<br>
            Vivid pictures of my enemies, family times<br>
            God to forgive me 'cause it's wrong, but I plan to die<br>
            Either take me in Heaven and understand I was a G.<br>
            Did the best I could, raised in insanity<br>
            Or send me to Hell, 'cause I ain't begging for my life<br>

        <h2>Brenda’s Got a Baby</h2><br>
        <p><i>[Dave Hollister:]</i><br>
            Brenda's got a baby<br>
            <br>
            <i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            I hear Brenda's got a baby<br>
            But Brenda's barely got a brain<br>
            A damn shame, the girl can hardly spell her name<br>
            That's not our problem, that's up to Brenda's family<br>
            Well let me show you how it affects our whole community<br>
            Now Brenda really never knew her moms<br>
            And her dad was a junkie putting death into his arms<br>
            It's sad, cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know<br>
            Just cause you're in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow<br>
            But oh, that's a thought, my own revelation<br>
            Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation<br>
            Brenda got herself a boyfriend<br>
            Her boyfriend was her cousin, now let's watch the joy end<br>
            She tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family<br>
            Who really didn't care to see, or give a damn if she<br>
            Went out and had a church of kids<br>
            As long as when the check came they got first dibs<br>
            Now Brenda's belly's getting bigger<br>
            But no one seems to notice any change in her figure<br>
            She's twelve years old and she's having a baby<br>
            In love with a molester, who's sexing her crazy<br>
            And yet and she thinks that he'll be with her forever<br>
            And dreams of a world where the two of them are together, whatever<br>
            He left her and she had the baby solo<br>
            She had it on the bathroom floor and didn't know so<br>
            She didn't know, what to throw away and what to keep<br>
            She wrapped the baby up and threw him in a trash heap<br>
            I guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the cries<br>
            She didn't realize how much the little baby had her eyes<br>
            Now the baby's in the trash heap bawling<br>
            Momma can't help her, but it hurts to hear her calling<br>
            Brenda wants to run away<br>
            Momma say, you making me lose pay<br>
            There's social workers here every day<br>
            Now Brenda's gotta make her own way<br>
            Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay<br>
            No money no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job<br>
            She tried to sell crack but end up getting robbed<br>
            So now what's next, there ain't nothing left to sell<br>
            So she sees sex as a way of leaving hell<br>
            It's paying the rent, so she really can't complain<br>
            Prostitute, found slain and Brenda's her name, she's got a baby</p>

            Now we was once two niggas of the same kind<br>
            Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line <br>
            You was just a little smaller but you still rolled<br>
            Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll<br>
            'member when you had a Jheri Curl didn't quite learn<br>
            On the block, wit'cha Glock, trippin' off sherm<br>
            Collect calls to the crib, sayin' how you've changed<br>
            Oh you's a Muslim now? No more dope game<br>
            Heard you might be comin' home, just got bail<br>
            Wanna go to the Mosque, don't wanna chase tail<br>
            It seems I lost my little homie, he's a changed man<br>
            Hit the pen and now no sinnin' is the game plan<br>
            When I talk about money all you see is the struggle<br>
            When I tell you I'm livin' large you tell me it's trouble<br>
            Congratulations on the wedding, I hope your wife know<br>
            She got a playa for life, and that's no bullshittin'<br>
            I know we grew apart, you probably don't remember<br>
            I used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her<br>
            And I can see us after school, we'd BOMB<br>
            on the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on<br>
            Now the whole shit's changed and we don't even kick it<br>
            Got a big money scheme and you ain't even with it<br>
            Hmm, knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker that<br>
            Go toe to toe when it's time to roll you got a brother's back<br>
            And I can't even trip, cause I'm just laughin' at 'cha<br>
            You tryin' hard to maintain, then go ahead<br>
            Cause I ain't mad at 'cha<br>

            We used to be like distant cousins<br>
            Fightin', playin' dozens, whole neighborhood buzzin'<br>
            Knowin' that we wasn't<br>
            Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs<br>
            I'm gettin' blitzed and I reminisce on all the times we shared<br>
            Besides, bumpin' 'n grindin' wasn't nothin' on our mind<br>
            In time we'd learned to live a life of crime<br>
            Rewind us back to a time was much too young to know<br>
            I caught a felony lovin' the way the guns blow<br>
            And even though we separated, you said that you'd wait<br>
            Don't give nobody no coochie while I'll be locked up state<br>
            I kiss my momma, goodbye, and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes<br>
            Said I'll return but I gotta fight the fate's arrived<br>
            Don't shed a tear, cause momma I ain't happy here<br>
            I blew trial, no more smiles for a couple years<br>
            They got me goin' mad<br>
            I'm knockin' busters on they backs, in my cell, thinkin'<br>
            "Hell, I know one day I'll be back"<br>
            As soon as I touch down<br>
            I told my girl I'll be there, so prepare, to get fucked down<br>
            The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin' at 'cha<br>

            Bitches be callin' to get it, hookers keep fallin' down<br>
            He went from nothing to lots, ten carats to rock<br>
            Went from a nobody nigga to the big man on the block<br>
            He's Mr. Local-Celebrity, addicted to movin' ki's<br>
            Most hated by enemies, escape in the luxury<br>
            See, first you was our nigga but you made it, so the choice is made<br>
            Now we gotta slay you while you faded, in the younger days<br>
            So full of pain while the weapons blaze<br>
            Gettin' so high off that bomb hopin' we make it, to the better days<br>
            Cause crime pays and in time, you'll find a rhyme'll blaze<br>
            You'll feel the fire from the niggas in my younger days<br>
            So many changed on me, so many tried to plot<br>
            That I keep a glock beside my head, when will it stop?<br>
            'Til God return me to my essence<br>
            Cause even as an adolescent, I refuse to be a convalescent<br>
            So many questions and they ask me if I'm still down<br>
            I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?<br>
            They got so much to say, but I'm just laughin' at 'cha<br>

            I don't want it if it's that easy<br>
            Ayo, bust it, baby got a problem, saying "bye-bye"<br>

        <h2>Changes</h2><br>
        <p><i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself:<br>
            "Is life worth living? Should I blast myself?"<br>
            I'm tired of being poor and, even worse, I'm black<br>
            My stomach hurts so I'm looking for a purse to snatch<br>
            Cops give a damn about a negro<br>
            Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero<br>
            "Give the crack to the kids: who the hell cares?<br>
            One less hungry mouth on the welfare!"<br>
            First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers<br>
            Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other<br>
            "It's time to fight back," that's what Huey said<br>
            Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead<br>
            I got love for my brother<br>
            But we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other<br>
            We gotta start making changes<br>
            Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers<br>
            And that's how it's supposed to be<br>
            How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?<br>
            I'd love to go back to when we played as kids<br>
            But things change... and that's the way it is<br>

            I see no changes, all I see is racist faces<br>
            Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races<br>
            We under, I wonder what it takes to make this<br>
            One better place, let's erase the wasted<br>
            Take the evil out the people, they'll be acting right<br>
            'Cause both Black and White are smoking crack tonight<br>
            And the only time we chill is when we kill each other<br>
            It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other<br>
            And although it seems heaven-sent<br>
            We ain't ready to see a black president<br>
            It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact:<br>
            The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks<br>
            But some things will never change<br>
            Try to show another way, but you staying in the dope game<br>
            Now tell me, what's a mother to do?<br>
            Being real don't appeal to the brother in you<br>
            You gotta operate the easy way<br>
            "I made a G today," but you made it in a sleazy way<br>
            Selling crack to the kids<br>
            "I gotta get paid!", well hey, but that's the way it is<br>

            We gotta make a change<br>
            It's time for us as a people to start making some changes<br>
            Let's change the way we eat, let's change the way we live<br>
            And let's change the way we treat each other<br>
            You see the old way wasn't working<br>
            So it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive<br>
            <br>
            <i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            And still I see no changes<br>
            Can't a brother get a little peace?<br>
            It's war on the streets and a war in the Middle East<br>
            Instead of war on poverty<br>
            They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me<br>
            And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do<br>
            But now I'm back with the facts giving it back to you<br>
            Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up<br>
            Crack you up and pimp-smack you up<br>
            You gotta learn to hold your own<br>
            They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone<br>
            But tell the cops they can't touch this<br>
            I don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this<br>
            That's the sound of my tool<br>
            You say it ain't cool, my mama didn't raise no fool<br>
            And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped<br>
            And I never get to lay back<br>
            'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback<br>
            Some buck that I roughed up way back<br>
            Coming back after all these years<br>

        <h2>Dear Mama</h2><br>
        <p><i>[2pac:]</i><br>
            You are appreciated<br>
            When I was young, me and my mama had beef<br>
            17 years old, kicked out on the streets<br>
            Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face<br>
            Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place<br>
            Suspended from school<br>
            And scared to go home, I was a fool<br>
            With the big boys breaking all the rules<br>
            I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years<br>
            We was poorer than the other little kids<br>
            And even though we had different daddies, the same drama<br>
            When things went wrong we'd blame mama<br>
            I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell<br>
            Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell<br>
            And who'd think in elementary, hey<br>
            I'd see the penitentiary one day?<br>
            And running from the police, that's right<br>
            Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside<br>
            And even as a crack fiend, mama<br>
            You always was a black queen, mama<br>
            I finally understand<br>
            For a woman it ain't easy trying to raise a man<br>
            You always was committed<br>
            A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it<br>
            There's no way I can pay you back, but the plan<br>
            Is to show you that I understand; you are appreciated<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Reggie Green and "Sweet Franklin" (2Pac):]</i><br>
            Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)<br>
            Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)<br>
            Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?<br>
            <br>
            <i>[2pac:]</i><br>
            Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair<br>
            No love from my daddy, 'cause the coward wasn't there<br>
            He passed away and I didn't cry, 'cause my anger<br>
            wouldn't let me feel for a stranger<br>
            They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along<br>
            I was looking for a father he was gone<br>
            I hung around with the thugs<br>
            And even though they sold drugs<br>
            They showed a young brother love<br>
            I moved out and started really hangin'<br>
            I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'<br>
            I ain't guilty, 'cause even though I sell rocks<br>
            It feels good putting money in your mailbox<br>
            I love paying rent when the rent is due<br>
            I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you<br>
            'Cause when I was low you was there for me<br>
            And never left me alone, because you cared for me<br>
            And I could see you coming home after work late<br>
            You're in the kitchen, trying to fix us a hot plate<br>
            You just working with the scraps you was given<br>
            And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'<br>
            But now the road got rough, you're alone<br>
            You're trying to raise two bad kids on your own<br>
            And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan<br>
            Is to show you that I understand; you are appreciated<br>

            <i>[2pac:]</i><br>
            Pour out some liquor and I reminisce<br>
            'Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama<br>
            And when it seems that I'm hopeless<br>
            You say the words that can get me back in focus<br>
            When I was sick as a little kid<br>
            To keep me happy, there's no limit to the things you did<br>
            And all my childhood memories<br>
            Are full of all the sweet things you did for me<br>
            And even though I act crazy<br>
            I gotta thank the Lord that you made me<br>
            There are no words that can express how I feel<br>
            You never kept a secret, always stayed real<br>
            And I appreciate how you raised me<br>
            And all the extra love that you gave me<br>
            I wish I could take the pain away<br>
            If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day<br>
            Everything will be alright if you hold on<br>
            It's a struggle everyday, gotta roll on<br>
            And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan<br>
            Is to show you that I understand; you are appreciated<br>

            "Right, but don't you feel like that creates tension between East and West? I mean, he's talking about killing people, 'I had sex with your wife' — and not in those words. But he's talking about, 'I wanna see you deceased'…"<br>

            To live and die in L.A., California<br>
            What you say about Los Angeles?<br>
            Still the only place for me<br>
            It never rains in Southern California<br>
            <br>
            <i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            To live and die in L.A.<br>
            Where everyday we try to fatten our pockets<br>
            Us niggas hustle for the cash, so it's hard to knock it<br>
            Everybody got they own thing, currency chasin'<br>
            Worldwide through the hard times, worrying faces<br>
            Shed tears as we bury niggas close to heart<br>
            Who was a friend is now a ghost in the dark<br>
            Cold-hearted 'bout it, nigga got smoked by a fiend<br>
            Tryin' to floss on him, blind to a broken man's dream<br>
            A hard lesson, court cases keep me guessin'<br>
            Plea bargain ain't an option now, so I'm stressin'<br>
            Cost me more to be free than a life in the pen<br>
            Making money off of cuss words, writin' again<br>
            Learn how to think ahead, so I fight with my pen<br>
            Late night down sunset, likin' the scene<br>
            What's the worst they could do to a nigga?<br>
            Got me lost in Hell, to live and die in L.A. on bail<br>

            9-1-1! It's an emergency, cowards tried to murder me<br>
            From hood to the 'burbs, everyone of you niggas heard of me<br>
            Shit, I'm legendary niggas scary and paralyzed<br>
            Nothing more I despise than a liar<br>
            Cowards die<br>
            My mama told me when I was a seed<br>
            Just a vicious motherfucker why these devils left me free<br>
            I proceed to make them shiver<br>
            When I deliver<br>
            Criminal lyrics<br>
            From a world wide mob figure<br>
            Thug niggas from everywhere Mr. Makaveli<br>
            Niggas is waiting for some thug shit, that's what they tell me<br>
            So many rumors but I'm infinite Immortal Outlaw<br>
            Switching up on you ordinary bitches<br>
            Like a southpaw you get left<br>
            And every breath I breathe until the moment I'm deceased<br>
            Will be another moment ballin' as a 'G'<br>
            I rip the crowd, then I start again<br>
            Eternally I live in sin<br>
            Until the moment that they let me breathe again<br>
            The heartz of men<br>
            <br>
            The hearts of men<br>
            <br>
            My lyrical verse was so much pain, to some niggas it hurts<br>
            My guns bust and, if you ain't one of us, it gets worse<br>
            Bitch niggas get their eyes swoll<br>
            In fly mode<br>
            I'm a homicidal outlaw<br>
            And 5-0, get your lights on, the fight's on<br>
            Tonight's gonna be a fucking fight<br>
            So we might roll<br>
            My own homies say I'm heartless<br>
            But I'm a G to this til the day I'm gone, that's regardless<br>
            Ride by, niggas bow down<br>
            Thought I'd rot in jail, paid bail, well, nigga's out now<br>
            Throw up your hands if you thugged out<br>
            First nigga act up<br>
            First nigga getting drugged out<br>
            I can be a villain if ya let me<br>
            But motherfucker if ya do upset me<br>
            Tell the cops to come and get me<br>
            Rip the crowd like a phone number<br>
            Then start again, don't have no mutherfuckin' friends, nigga<br>
            Look inside the hearts of men<br>
            <br>
            In the hearts of men<br>
            <br>
            To all my niggas engaged in making money in the fifty states<br>
            Keep your mind on your chips and fuck a punk bitch<br>
            No longer living in fear, my pistol close in hand<br>
            Convinced this is my year, like I'm the chosen man<br>
            Give me my money and label me as a don<br>
            If niggas is having problems<br>
            Smoke' em, fire and bomb<br>
            I died and came back<br>
            I hustle with these lyrics as if it's a game of crack<br>
            Thugging is in my spirit<br>
            I'm lost and not knowing<br>
            Scared up, but still flowing<br>
            Energized and still going<br>
            Uh, can it be fate<br>
            That makes a sick motherfucker break<br>
            On these jealous ass coward cause they evil and fake<br>
            What will it take ?<br>
            Give me that bass line, I'm feeling bomb<br>
            Death Row, baby, don't be alarmed<br>
            The homie Quik gave a nigga a beat and let me start again<br>
            Represent<br>
            Cause I've been sent<br>
