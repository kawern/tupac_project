            I started young, kickin' dust and livin' rough<br>
            You watch your mouth around my mama you couldn't cuss, man<br>
            I had a down ass homie though; we ran the streets<br>
            And on the scene at the age of fourteen, huh<br>
            I packed a nine and my nigga packed a forty-five<br>
            We drinkin' forties, lil' shorties livin' naughty lives<br>
            You couldn't stop us, long as I got my glock, FUCK the coppers <br>
            Hangin' on the block, slangin' rocks and makin' profits<br>
            I couldn't fuck with the school life, I was a fool<br>
            I'll play that motherfucker for a tool, man<br>
            Tonight'll be the night that's what we thinkin'<br>
            Hustlin' in the rain felt no pain cause we drinkin'<br>
            Playin' them hoes like manure<br>
            First let my nigga fuck and then I fuck<br>
            That's how we do it (haha)<br>
            It's two niggas comin' up out the hood<br>
            Livin' life just as good as we could<br>

            Boxin' with them suckers 'til my knuckles turn purple<br>
            Mama told me, "Son there'll be days like this"<br>
            Don't wanna think so - I hit the drink and stay blitzed<br>
            We had plans of being big time G's<br>
            Rollin' in mob cars, movin' them keys<br>
            And now I roll up the window, blaze up some indo<br>

            Hangin' with hogs, droppin' dawgs as a little loc<br>
            I was gettin' my respect but I was still broke<br>
            Into the game and expanded to the cocaine<br>
            Went from double-ups, to slangin' them whole thangs<br>
            Focused on my mail name ringin' like a bell<br>
            And even with no proof they gonna put me in jail<br>
            Everybody says he's sold and I'm outta control<br>
            Motherfuckers gossip but I still roll (nigga)<br>
            Bitches want my cash on my dash of my cockpit<br>
            They wouldn't know a motherfucker if he didn't have shit<br>
            So while I'm ballin' and kickin' up dust, get yo' skull crushed<br>
            Bitch-made niggas know not to fuck with us<br>
            Cause I'm livin' on the edge, I'm blastin' lead<br>
            Wanted by the Feds, they got to take me dead<br>
            So fuck it drive a bucket in the inner city<br>
            In the land of no pity, I made it by the street fame<br>
            <br>

        <p>From the cradle to the grave<br>
            Life ain't never been easy<br>
            Livin' in the ghetto<br>
            From the cradle to the grave<br>
            Life ain't never been easy<br>
            <br>
            <i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            June 16th, 1971<br>
            Mama gave birth to a hell-raisin' heavenly son<br>
            See, the doctor tried to smack me, but I smacked him back<br>
            My first words was, "Thug for life!" and "Papa, pass the MAC!"<br>
            I'm bustin' on these mother fuckers ballin'<br>
            Listen, you can hear my mini fourteen callin'<br>
            From out the window of my drop top<br>
            I got my Glock cocked, bustin' at niggas; when will it stop?<br>
            Now, tell me, are you scared of the dark?<br>
            Can't close my eyes, I see visions<br>
            And even with this thug livin', will I escape prison?<br>
            Penitentiary chances was an all day thang<br>
            The only way to advance; and if you slang<br>
            Then you'd better have your Nikes on, 'cause when we fight, it's in the middle of the night with no lights on<br>
            Hey! There must be a God, 'cause I feel lucky<br>
            Paranoid, out my mind, 'cause motherfuckers tryin' to rush me<br>
            Am I goin' to jail? Look at me bailin'<br>
            Comin' out the court house, all about my mail and bank<br>
            Never die, I'll be a hustler, motherfuckers<br>
            Makin' thugs out you suckers, from the cradle to the grave<br>
            <br>
            From the cradle to the grave<br>
            Life ain't never been easy<br>
            Livin' in the ghetto<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Mopreme:]</i><br>
            From the cradle to the grave, since a little bitty child<br>
            I've been known to get ill and kinda buck wild<br>
            Pop pop! Just like the part that's in my walk with street talk<br>
            I'm runnin' up the block in the dark where lead spark<br>
            Surveillance on a nigga every day<br>
            Waitin on my daddy just to take his ass away<br>
            Now Mama always workin', tryin' to make ends meet<br>
            So now a young nigga's being raised by the streets<br>
            And then the only other one that ever showed me love<br>
            Was my dope fiend uncle, strung out on drugs<br>
            A straight thug, just me, my mama out here on our own<br>
            So I got two gats, one black and one of chrome<br>
            Now, I don't wanna hurt nobody, but I must defend mine<br>
            It's all the fuck I got, so stop and walk a thin line<br>
            Young niggas be brave<br>
            And keep on thuggin' from the cradle to the grave<br>
            <br>
            From the cradle to the grave<br>
            Life ain't never been easy<br>
            Livin' in the ghetto<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Rated R:]</i><br>
            From the cradle to the grave, I'm glad to say I made it this far<br>
            Many G's died, hogs<br>
            And all they got was they name hit up on a wall<br>
            It's sad thinkin' about the times, life goes on<br>
            I'm steady lost in this land, that's the war zone<br>
            I gots no home, don't have no friends neither<br>
            It's just me by my lonely, so I married my Nina<br>
            I keeps her wherever I go, I love my ho<br>
            Never leave home without my sugar, I'ma have to plug a nigga<br>
            Mama told me not to trust no punks<br>
            And kick his ass if he lay a hand on me<br>
            Since then I been knowin'<br>
            Sometimes I think my own self stupid<br>
            'Cause I stay shootin' at marks<br>
            Get twisted up in police reports<br>
            Since the cradle, I've been ungrateful<br>
            My first toy was a gun<br>
            I got sprung and learned to love weapons<br>
            But now I'm through with money<br>
            And through with street fame<br>
            Somebody peeled my cap, and put me in my grave<br>
            <br>
            From the cradle to the grave<br>
            Life ain't never been easy<br>

            <i>[Macadoshis:]</i><br>
            March 18th, a rainy day my mama gave birth<br>
            To a baby boy trapped in Hell on Earth<br>
            From day one it wasn't fun, I never had a crumb<br>
            Daddy worked two jobs and Mama won't stop drinkin' rum<br>
            I tried to cope, loc, but my family's broke<br>
            And my pocket's short, so now I got ta slang dope<br>
            In the game filled with pain, it's a fuckin' shame<br>
            The white man got a motherfucker slangin' 'caine<br>
            So now it's on from dusk to dawn, I'm gettin' my serve on<br>
            Always in the spot with my Glock, slingin' rocks at the Rox<br>
            The shit don't stop, I'm steady dodgin' cops<br>
            I never flip-flop, hear my Glock cock, thug 'til I drop<br>
            And if I hit the pen, I gotta do my time<br>
            Sittin' on my bunk, reminiscin' 'bout the good times<br>
            It's fucked up a nigga gotta grow up doin' dirt<br>
            But from the cradle to the grave I'ma put in work<br>
            <br>
            From the cradle to the grave<br>
            Life ain't never been easy<br>
            Livin' in the ghetto<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Big Syke:]</i><br>
            Time's movin' fast; will I last another day?<br>
            So I pray and I lay with my AK<br>
            Did I sell my soul as a young kid? All the things I did<br>
            Wishin' someone held me, but they never did<br>
            I can't take it; will I make it to my older age<br>
            Before I'm shot up or locked up in a fuckin' cage?<br>
            Lord, help me, guide me, save me!<br>
            'Cause that's the way that Daddy raised me: crazy<br>
            Do or die, nigga, pull the trigger, don't give a fuck<br>
            You'd rather be in jail than get yo' ass bucked<br>
            Nobody cares, it's me against the world<br>
            Keepin' murder on my mind and my TEC-9<br>
            I got nothin' to lose, payin' dues, nigga, you wanna die?<br>
            I get high and then my mission is a walk-by<br>
            You'd better jet when I hit your set, 'cause I'm comin'<br>
            Start runnin', yellin' "evil mind" as I'm gunnin'<br>
            One in the chamber, for the anger that I build inside<br>
            For the mothers that cried, for my homies that died<br>
            The beginnin' is an endin', am I just a slave?<br>
            So I got to be brave, from the cradle to the grave<br>
            <br>
            From the cradle to the grave<br>
            Life ain't never been easy<br>
            Livin' in the ghetto

        <h2>Str8 Ballin’</h2><br>
        <p>I would share the definition of ballin' with you white folks<br>
            But no<br>
            I'm up before the sunrise, first to hit the block<br>
            Little bad mothafucka with a pocket full of rocks<br>
            And I'm totin' these thangs, get my skinny little ass kicked<br>
            And niggas laugh, til' tha first mothafucka got blasted<br>
            I put the nigga in his casket<br>
            Now they coverin' the bastard in plastic<br>
            I smoke blunts on a regular buck when it counts<br>
            I'm tryin' to make a million dollars outta quarter ounce<br>
            And gettin' lost on the five-o, fuck them hoes<br>
            Got a 45 screamin' about survival<br>
            Hey nigga can I lay low, cook some yay-yo<br>
            Hollar "one-time" when I say so<br>
            Don't want to go to the pen, I'm hittin' fences<br>
            Narcs on a nigga's back, missin' me by inches<br>
            And they say how do you survive weighin' 165<br>
            In a city where the skinny niggas die?<br>
            Tell Mama don't cry<br>
            Even when they kill me<br>
            They can never take the game from a young G<br>

            Still on parole and I'm the first nigga servin'<br>
            Pour some liquor on the curb for my niggas that deserve it<br>
            But if I want to make a million, gotta stay dealin'<br>
            It's kinda boomin' and today I'll make a killin'<br>
            Dressin' down like a villain, but only on the block<br>
            It's a clever disguise to keep me runnin' from the cops<br>
            Ha, I'm gettin' high. I think I'll die if I don't get no ends<br>
            I'm in a bucket with 'em ridin' it like it's a Benz<br>
            I hate to stip let my music bump<br>
            Drinkin' liquor, and I'm lookin' for some hoes to fuck<br>
            Rather die makin' money than live poor and legal<br>
            As I slang another ounce, I wish it was a kilo<br>
            A need money in a major way<br>
            Time to fuck my BEEEYATCHHey!, and getten' paid<br>

            I keep a pistol in my pocket<br>
            Ready on my block<br>
            Ain't no time for a nigga to even cock shit<br>
            And now they see that mothafucka beat pain<br>
            At point blank range cause he slept on the game<br>
            Ain't a damned thing changed<br>
            Shakin' the dice, now roll 'em<br>
            If you can't stand pain better hold 'em<br>
            Cause ain't no tellin' what you might roll<br>
            You might go catch AIDS from a slight cold. Nigga<br>

            I need it cause they're all shady<br>
            I finally made it<br>
            Now these jealous bitches tryin' to FADE me<br>
            I ain't goin' out I'd rather blast back<br>

            And I came up a long way from food stamps<br>
            And takin' shit from the low-life ghetto tramps<br>
