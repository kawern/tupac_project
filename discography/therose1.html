            <br>
            War was gone because all was at peace<br>

            When your heart turns cold<br>
            I say, when your heart turns cold<br>
            it causes your soul to freeze<br>
            It spreads, throughout yo' spirit<br>
            like a, ruthless, feeling disease<br>
            The walls, the walls that once were down<br>
            now stand firm and tall, safe from hate love pain joy<br>
            until you feel nothing at all<br>
            When, your heart turns cold<br>
            I say, when your heart turns cold<br>
            A baby's cry, means nothing<br>
            A dead corpose is tri-vial<br>
            Mother's neglecting children is daily<br>
            Loneliness, becomes your routine friend<br>
            Death death death seems like tranquility<br>
            Sleeping is never pleasant<br>
            if you even sleep at all all all<br>
            You forget ideals and, turn off the reason<br>
            to make sure the product gets sold<br>
            You don't UNDERSTAND how I behave, just wait<br>
            I say just WAIT WAIT WAIT til your heart<br>
            I say til your hearts turns COLD!<br>
            HA HA! Cold! Cold, cold, cold.. collllld.</p>

            I know my heart has lied before<br>
            but now it speaks, with honesty<br>
            of an invisible bond of friendship, that was formed, in secrecy<br>
            Coming from me this may seem hard but, but to God I swear - it's truth<br>
            We are friends for eternity and for-ever I will always love.. you..<br>

            Does love exist without a title<br>

            All my life I've dreamed of<br>
            of meeting one with immense beauty and<br>
            and once I found her I would charm her and<br>
            and she'd be mine forever (mine forever)<br>
            I found her and, indeed she is all that I, wished for and more but she<br>
            is not charmed nor intrigued (not charmed, nor intrigued)<br>
            Then I think to myself what.. can I offer her<br>
            The tears warm my eyes and blur my, vision I<br>
            stick to my stance of bravado and give her<br>
            the same uninterested look that she, gave, me<br>
            (She was so beautiful) She was so beautiful<br>
            But what.. can I offer her?<br>
            <br>
            You say that you'll love me forever but<br>
            but what about today?<br>
            As the dusks become the dawns and the years pass on will you<br>
            love me (love me) the same way (the same way)?<br>
            If so let us rejoice and bathe in this constant pleasure<br>
            If not spare my heart today and I shall recover before, forever<br>
            And if my doubts and questions upset you<br>
            (forgive my fragile heart) forgive my fragile heart<br>
            I just wanted to know if you'd love me forever before today, <br>
            would start (would you love me.. would you love me..)<br>

            Sometimes when I'm alone<br>

            All the tears I cry are bitter and warm<br>
            They flow with life, and take no form<br>
            Ah the world moves fast<br>
            and it would rather pass you on by<br>
            than to stop and see what makes you cry<br>
            It's painful, so sad, sometimes I cry<br>
            <br>
            But no one really cares..<br>
            to ask why, why, why<br>
            <br>
            Well I cry because my heart is torn<br>
            I find it hard to carry on<br>
            And if I had an ear to confide in<br>
            I would cry amongst my treasured friends<br>
            A-but who do you know that stops that long<br>
            to help another carry on<br>
            Ah the world moves fast<br>

            There you have it..<br>
            Y'know, when I was younger I prayed, to get in this game<br>
            Y'know to hold dis microphone in my hand<br>
            I asked the man upstairs, to let me rock a crowd one day<br>
            Y'know let people out there feel the way I feel through my music<br>
            Like my homeboy Tupac did fo' sho'<br>
            And he gave that to me<br>
            But he didn't he didn't he didn't let me know<br>
            about all the shady shit that's in, in between<br>
            you and yo' dream, y'know?<br>
            See it's more than the music, I spit it from the heart<br>
            So sometime it's cold n it's dark, but it's raw<br>
            And that's how I'ma bring it to you every time, y'know?<br>

            Why must you be unfaithful?  For women..<br>
            Men, you shouldn't listen to your selfish heart<br>
            It doesn't really have a brain<br>
            Besides keepin you alive, it's existence is in vain<br>
            And how could I be so mean, and say your heart has no place?<br>
            Because mortal men fall in love again<br>
            as fast as they change their face<br>
            I may be cruel, but think awhile about the hearts that you have broken<br>
            and match that, with the empty vows and broken promises you've spoken<br>
            Now I'm not saying females are perfect<br>
            cause we know, it's not true<br>
            But why must you be unfaithful<br>
            if her heart is true to you</p>

            Excuse me - but, Lady Liberty needs glasses<br>
            and so does Mrs. Justice by her side<br>
            Both the broads are blind as bats, stumblin through - the system<br>
            Justice bumped into M'Tulu, trippin on Geronimo Pratt<br>
            but stepped right over Oliver and his crooked partner Ronnie<br>
            Justice stubbed her big toe on Mandela<br>
            And Liberty was misquoted by the Indians<br>
            Slavery was just a learning phase, forgotten without a verdict<br>
            while Justice is on a rampage<br>
            for endangered survivin black males<br>
            I mean really; if anyone REALLY valued life<br>
            and cared about the masses<br>
            They'd take 'em both to Pen Optical<br>
            and get TWO pairs of glasses<br>

            Loneliness was a daily for me, until you came along<br>
            There was a gleam of a star in your eyes<br>
            Thought I'd never feel this way again<br>
            And you were supposed to reach my heart<br>
            And find love within, looove, looove<br>
            Oooh...oooh<br>
            <br>
            Love within a storm <i>[x4]</i><br>
            This sweet, wonderful ghetto love<br>
            This sweet, wonderful love that you give me<br>
            Wonderful<br>
            <br>
            I could not ignore the magnetism, when I felt you near<br>
            Any problems plaguin' my mind, was suddenly dissapeared<br>
            It was re-birth of my heart, the day that you became my friend<br>
            'Cause I knew for the moment I held you, that I would fall in love again<br>
            <br>
            Fall in love again, in a storm<br>
            Love within a storm <i>[Continues in background throughout next verses]</i><br>
            <br>
            Just when I thought I'd seen it all<br>
            Our paths crossed, amen<br>
            And I knew, from the first glance<br>
            That you, would be hard to forget<br>
            Your eyes, attracted me first<br>
            But you reeked of sultry confidence<br>
            I couldn't wait, to touch lips<br>
            And kiss, with my heart's intention<br>
            When we didn't, was what I expected<br>
            And for that moment, we erased the tension<br>
            Of the awkwardness, of first date jitters<br>
            And the initial blind date, first impressions<br>
            We kissed again; and I felt the passion<br>
            And this, my love, was Cupid's blessin'<br>
            <br>
            We made love, within a storm<br>
            In the midst of passion and chaos<br>
            Somewhere, somehow, our true bond of friendship was lost<br>
            In the eye of the storm, the rain always falls harder<br>
            Those who prevail this drama<br>
            Will learn to bring their love farther<br>
            But now, the storm has past<br>
            And the seas of our friendship are gone<br>
            But as long as I live, I will remember<br>
            The love within a storm<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Love within a storm is repeated after every line]</i><br>
            Sweet, passionate, love-lusting love<br>
            Ya know that I miss you, and love you<br>
            Ya know that Tupac broke my heart<br>
            We need to hear ya, hear ya voice<br>

            Your ways are similar, to the raisin sun<br>
            Warm to me, but too strong for some <br>
            The more you are needed, the brighter you shine<br>
            Watch them for too long, your brilliance will blind<br>
            The eyes of mortal men, threaten you with doom<br>
            They regret to see you, set, but it is time, for the moon</p>
