        <h2>Letter to the President</h2><br>
        <p><i>[E.D.I. (2Pac):]</i><br>
            Uh, dear Mr. President. What's happenin'?<br>
            I'm writin' you because<br>
            Shit is still real fucked up in my neighborhood<br>
            Pretty much the same way<br>
            Right around the time when you got elected…<br>
            Ain't nothin' changed. All the promises you made, before you got elected… they ain't came true<br>
            (Tell me what to do, these niggas actin' up in the hood)<br>
            (Send mo' troops, dear Mr. President)<br>
            Me and my homies is wonderin' what's goin' on… holla!<br>
            (Tell me what to do, these niggas actin' up in the hood)<br>
            (Send mo' troops…)<br>
            <br>
            <i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            Why should I lie when I can dramatize?<br>
            Niggas fell victim to my lyrics, now traumatized<br>
            Simply by spittin' I've been blessed given riches<br>
            Enemies suspicious cuz I'm seldom in the company of bitches<br>
            Plus the concepts I depict so visual that you can kiss<br>
            Each and every trick or bitch, inside the shit I kick<br>
            My heaviest verse'll move a mountain<br>
            Casualties in mass amounts, brothers keep countin'<br>
            Fuck the friendships, I ride alone<br>
            Destination: Death Row – finally found a home<br>
            Plus all my homies wanna die; call it euthanasia<br>
            Dear Lord, look how sick this ghetto made us<br>
            Sincerely yours, I'm a thug, the product of a broken home<br>
            Everybody's doped up, nigga, what you smokin' on?<br>
            Figure if we high they can train us<br>
            But then America fucked up and blamed us<br>
            I guess it's cause we black that we targets<br>
            My only fear is God, I spit that hard shit<br>
            In case you don't know I let my pump go<br>
            Get it ride for Mutulu like I ride for Geronimo<br>
            Down to die for everything I represent<br>
            Meant every word in my letter to the President<br>

            Cause yo', I spend my nights out, with the lights out<br>
            Under the safety of darkness, amongst the crazed and the heartless<br>
            And young soul bros, ready to rode a starship<br>
            <i>[?]</i>, leave a nigga flat for scratch<br>
            The Godless, I gotta get chips, but you can't understand that<br>
            Wanna ban rap? - Stand back, before you get hurt<br>
            It's the only thing nigga pay the paper besides smoke and work<br>
            On a mission, listen <i>[?]</i> with precision<br>
            First made my decision, I realized this ain't livin'<br>
            Trippin' to drastic measures, tryin' to get stacks of cheddar<br>
            Motherfuckers hate cops, wait, it ain't gettin' better<br>
            But you keep tellin' us that it is<br>
            While your motherfuckin' troops keep killin' our kids<br>
            Dig, don't be surprised if you see us<br>
            Dumpin' with nothing but artillery to free us, motherfucker<br>

            <i>[Kastro:]</i><br>
            Strapped and angry, with no hope, and heart-broke<br>
            Fightin' first my trained brain until it's not so<br>
            It's hostile, niggas lick shots to watch the Glocks glow<br>
            Cadres of coppers patrol us like we some animals<br>
            And it ain't no peace, my peace a piece on my streets<br>
            To people beefin' and things squeakin' on they beefs for weeks<br>
            Mr. President, it's evident, nobody really care<br>
            For a struggler out the gutter, 22 with gray hair<br>
            I was raised to raise hell, frail and my heart stale<br>
            So I'ma bring hell to earth until my heart fail<br>
            But y'all play fair, give me and mine, I'll share<br>
            'Til y'all show us you care, it's gon' be mayhem out here<br>
            Me and these 223's will freeze the biggest with ease<br>
            I'm still a nigga you fear, bring the beast to his knees<br>
            And I've been born to represent, for that I've been heaven-sent<br>
            And I meant every word in my letter to the President<br>
            <br>
            <i>[E.D.I. Mean:]</i><br>
            Shit is still fucked up, y'all. And y'all wonder when it's gon' get better, and it ain't gon' get better<br>

            Heavenly Father, may I holla at you briefly?<br>
            I wanna meet the President, but will he meet me?<br>
            Is he scared to look inside the eyes of a thug nigga?<br>
            We tired of being scapegoats for this capitalistic drug dealin'<br>
            How hypocritical is Liberty?<br>
            That blind bitch ain't never did shit for me<br>
            My history full of casket and scars<br>
            My own black nation at war, whole family behind bars<br>
            And they wonder why we scarred, 13 lookin' hard<br>
            Sister had a baby as an adolescent, where was God?<br>
            Somewhere in the middle of my mind<br>
            Is a nigga on the tightrope, screamin', "Let him die!"<br>
            Can't lie, I'm a thug, drownin' in my own blood<br>
            Lookin' for the reason that my momma's strung out on drugs<br>
            Down to die for everything I represent<br>
            Meant every word in my letter to the President<br>

            Day after day, and night after night<br>

        <p><i>[Kastro]</i><br>
            Dear Lord, as we down here, struggle for as long as we know<br>
            In search of a paradise to touch (my nigga Johnny J)<br>
            Dreams are dreams, and reality seems to be the only place to go, the only place for us<br>
            I know, try to make the best of bad situations<br>
            Seems to be my life's story<br>
            Ain't no glory in pain, a soldier's story in vain<br>
            And can't nobody live this life for me<br>
            It's a ride y'all, a long hard ride<br>
            <br>
            <i>[2Pac]</i><br>
            Somebody wake me, I'm dreamin'<br>
            I started as a seed, the semen<br>
            Swimmin' upstream, planted in the womb while screamin'<br>
            On the top was my pops, my mama screamin' stop<br>
            From a single drop, this is what they got<br>
            Not to disrespect my peoples, but my papa was a loser<br>
            Only plan he had for mama was to fuck her and abuse her<br>
            Even as a little seed, I could see his plan for me<br>
            Stranded on welfare, another broken family<br>
            Now what was I to be? A product of this heated passion<br>
            Mama got pregnant and papa got a piece of ass<br>
            Look how it began, nobody gave a fuck about me<br>
            Pistol in my hand, this cruel world can do without me<br>
            How can I survive? Got me askin' white Jesus<br>
            "Will a nigga live or die?" cause the Lord can't see us<br>
            In the deep dark clouds of the projects, ain't no sunshine<br>
            No sunny days and we only play sometimes<br>
            When everybody's sleepin'<br>
            I open my window, jump to the streets and get to creepin'<br>
            I can live or die, hope I get some money 'fore I'm gone<br>
            I'm only 19, I'm tryna hustle on my own<br>
            On the spot where everybody and they pops tryna slang rocks<br>
            I'd rather go to college, but this is where the game stops<br>
            Don't get it wrong cause it's always on, from dusk to dawn<br>
            You can buy rocks, Glocks or a herringbone<br>
            You can ask my man, he's a mind reader<br>
            Keep my 9 heater all the time, this is how we grind<br>
            Meet up at the cemetery then get smoked out<br>
            Pass the weed, nigga! That Hennessey'll keep me keyed, nigga<br>
            Everywhere I go niggas holla at me, "Keep it real, G"<br>
            And my reply 'til they kill me: "Act up if you feel me!"<br>
            I was born not to make it, but I did<br>
            The tribulations of a ghetto kid, still I rise<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Ta'He]</i><br>
            Still I (still I), I rise (I rise), please, give me to the sky (to the sky)<br>

            Secrets of war prepare me for the worst<br>
            A life that's lavish, full of cabbage or a life that's in a hearse<br>

            So picture perfect at 13, an ebony queen<br>
            Beneath the surface it was more than just a crooked smile<br>
            Nobody knew about her secret so it took a while<br>
            I could see a tear fall slow down her black cheek<br>
            Sheddin' quiet tears in the back seat; so when she asked me<br>
            "What would you do if it was you?"<br>
            <br>
            Couldn't answer such a horrible pain to live through<br>
            I tried to trade places in the tragedy<br>
            I couldn't picture three crazed niggas grabbin' me<br>
            For just a moment I was trapped in the pain<br>
            Lord, come and take me<br>
            Four niggas violated, they chased and they raped me<br>
            Even though it wasn't me, I could feel the grief<br>

        <h2>As the World Turns</h2><br>
        <p><i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            As the world turns…<br>
            As the world turns my niggas grow and grow and grow<br>
            And get dough and roll and ride<br>
            Niggas die and mommas cry<br>
            Niggas got alibis and suicides and homicides<br>
            And three strikes and yo' life and my life and times change<br>
            And niggas fame, as the world turns…<br>
            <br>
            <i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            Though I walk through the valley of Hell the shadow follows me. Wisdom hard to swallow tomorrow, expect apologies<br>
            You probably panic, stranded in search of a better planet<br>
            Realism hard to understand, we stand slanted<br>
            And still stranded. Merciless thieves stole the best of me<br>
            I pray to black Jesus to please take the rest of me<br>
            And still, the best of us build and reach monetary gains<br>
            Some of us kill, but still, most of us can change <br>
            If we search deeper<br>
            God bless the hustler, curse the first sleeper<br>
            Enemies get beside me, flows go deep as Poseidon<br>
            When we ride, plots keep all my enemies blinded<br>
            Time will soon show, a thought can last for years<br>
            Outshinin' your fake smiles, plastic tears<br>
            Like last year, niggas stuck in the past, and it's clear<br>
            Just some busta ass bastards allergic to cash this year<br>

            Tear that ass out the frame, completely get that ass kicked<br>
            Woke up on the street, but you'll be sleepin' in the casket<br>
            How long will it last? Nigga, don't ask, just be first to blast<br>
            Outlaw on the mash, tryin' to be the first to see some cash<br>

            You recollects and see how crazy it sounds<br>
            The whole town's on a mission, adolescents (Penitentiary bound)<br>
            (Now introducin' Young Trigga)<br>
            Since birth, eyes set on gettin' bigger<br>
            Just another wild-ass nigga<br>
            (But he was fiendin' for Precious) WHAT?<br>
            (But Precious was a ghetto girl)<br>
            Couldn't be no sex without that gold Lexus<br>
            (But Lil' Trigga was heartbroken, he had to get his papers)<br>
            Seein' visions of people smokin' and niggas catchin' vapors<br>
            Got his man from around the corner (we call him Lil' Mo)<br>
            (Been in so many reform schools they had to let him go)<br>
            (Here's where the plot thickens)<br>
            They got a plot to make a profit with they Glocks spittin'<br>
            (They call the squad, hittin' blocks with they guns blowin')<br>
            (Somebody's gonna die tonight)<br>
            Still no one's knowin' so they kept goin'<br>
            Catchin' dealers comin' out they cars<br>
            (Will they survive? Two semi-automatic 9's)<br>
            (them niggas died)<br>
            (Plus nobody in the hood cries)<br>

            When we was kids, the lovin' felt good<br>
            But of course have the respect, though it's even better<br>
            Now for this chedder, niggas is layin' deader<br>
            Then Malcom and Martin, put together<br>
            Oh Lord only knows, where we'll end up<br>
            Remember<br>
            'Pac said: Watch the fuckin' signs<br>
            But we wasn't listenin', too busy tripping off his shine<br>
            Now one time for my muthafuckin' Outlawz<br>
            Napoleon, Noble, and Kastro, may we all roll<br>
            And if you don't know, we got the rap game petro<br>
            Scared cause we 'bout to release, like heavy metal<br>
            Nationwide, underground, we runnin' the ghettos<br>
            Stealin' all of ya fan base, like we kleptos<br>
            Bitch I can't let go<br>
            I been strugglin' too long, thuggin' too long<br>
            And niggas is stealin' my shit, and bustin' it wrong<br>
            Hot shots holla back, when you get 'em<br>
            Outlawz'll sic 'em, bustin' back at the system<br>
            Military wisdom, preparin' myself for Armageddon<br>
            Breakin' my balls at this game, knowin' it's a dead end<br>
            And my only weapon is my believe that I'm superior<br>
            Yeah, we the muthafuckas you niggas is liery off<br>
            Controlling my steam, knowin' my team, to serve more<br>
            Fuck the reframe, stick to the game and earn more<br>
            Holdin' my head, rollin' the head with focus<br>
            Laughin' inside, cause deep inside, y'all don't know us<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Young Noble:]</i><br>
            We will never fall<br>
            Through it all, we'll always stand tall (Why)<br>
            Cause in the end we'll be remembered as some young muthafucka soldiers<br>
            And if you believe in that shit that you heard<br>
            Y'all don't know us, y'all don't know us<br>
            We will never fall (Never)<br>
            Through it all, we'll always stand tall<br>
            Cause in the end we'll be remembered as some young muthafucka soldiers<br>
            And if you believe in that shit that you heard<br>
            Y'all don't know us, y'all don't know us<br>
            <br>
