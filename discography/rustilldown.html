            <br>
            Tell me, how many real motherfuckers feel me?<br>
            I smoke a blunt and freak the funk until these jealous motherfuckers kill me<br>
            I'm out the gutter, pick a hero<br>
            I'm 165 and stayin' high 'til I die, my competition's zero<br>
            Cause I could give a fuck about you, you better duck<br>
            Go or I'll be forced to hit yo' ass up, I give a fuck<br>
            I'm sick inside my mind, why they sweat me?<br>
            It's gonna take an army full of crooked ass cops to come and get me<br>
            Niggas know I ain't the one to sleep on, I'm under pressure<br>
            Gotta sleep with my piece, an extra clip beside my dresser<br>
            Word to God I've been ready to die since I was born<br>
            I don't want no shit but niggas trip and, yo, it's on<br>
            Open fire on my adversaries, don't even worry<br>
            Better have on a vest aim for the chest and then you buried<br>
            It's a man's world, niggas get played, another stray<br>
            Hope I live to see another day, hey!<br>
            I'm gettin' sweated by these undercovers<br>
            Who can I trust, got my mama stressin', thinkin' it's a drug bust<br>
            Gotta get paid but all the drama that's attached<br>
            We livin' a drug life, THUG LIFE, each day could be my last<br>
            Will I blast when it's time to shoot? Don't even ask<br>
            That's the consequences when ya livin' fast<br>
            Six bricks of tricks, for my niggas, I gotta come up<br>
            and recoup, you keep the dope just bring me six figures<br>
            Is it a bust? I hear the sirens, run for cover<br>
            over the fence and open fire<br>
            <br>
            "Alright now, here we go"<br>
            <br>
            These motherfuckers on my ass I'm in traffic, will it be tragic?<br>
            I'm comin' round the corner like I'm Magic<br>
            Doin' ninety on the freeway, and hittin' switches<br>
            In a high speed chase with these punk bitches<br>
            Don't turn around I ain't givin' up, cause they don't worry me<br>
            Pussy ass bitches better bury me<br>
            Runnin' outta gas time to park it, I'm on foot<br>
            We in the hood, how the fuck they gon catch a crook? Haha<br>
            I got away cause I'm clever<br>
            Went to my neighbors for a favor now you know players stick together<br>
            I watch the scene from the rooftop, spittin' loogies<br>
            At the coppers that pursue me, beotch!<br>
            I be a hustler til it's over, motherfucker<br>
            Open fire on you bustas<br>
            <br>
            "Alright now, here we go"<br>
            <br>
            Don't try to follow me, I'm headed outta state<br>
            I gotta pay my fuckin' bills, so I'm transportin' weight<br>
            Change my plates, pick up my nigga, and now we rollin'<br>
            Droppin' keys like they stolen, hehe<br>
            Tell me who do you fear? I'm outta town until the coast is clear<br>
            Enough dope to last a year<br>
            They got me runnin' from the police, nowhere to go<br>
            With the lights out, rollin' down a dirt road<br>
            But I ain't goin' alive, I'd rather die than be a convict<br>
            I'd rather fire on my target<br>
            I hit the corner doin' ninety, ah shit!<br>
            Them bitches right behind me<br>
            They take a shot and hit my fuckin' tires<br>
            Now, jump out the car then I open fire, sucka!<br>

        <p>Are you still down? <i>[3x]</i><br>
            <br>
            Now up and at 'em it's on, I was raised to be strong<br>
            And mama told me be a thug, since the day I was born<br>
            I came up, out the gutter never changed my style<br>
            Got for real about my papers, cause the game was wild<br>
            And the fame was a plot to try to change me<br>
            And what's strange is, nobody knew my name 'fore it came<br>
            Now the whole world is calling me a killer<br>
            All I ever did, was try to reach the kids with the real<br>
            All the time I was ballin', never heard my friends callin'<br>
            Couldn't stop myself from fallin', I'm all in<br>
            Shit's gettin' sleazy, believe me<br>
            Best to take what ya need, but don't be greedy<br>
            Cause in my mind, I see sunshine, I thought<br>
            I didn't have to run, now I'm duckin' from the gun yellin' "One time!"<br>
            Take your time to feel my record<br>
            And if you did, chill a second<br>
            My blind method, will still wreck it<br>
            My young homies stay strong<br>
            I wonder if they'll listen to a nigga when he gone<br>
            Are you still down?<br>
            <br>
            Raise 'em up ... are you still down?<br>
            Raise 'em up ... are you still down?<br>
            Raise 'em up ... are you still down?<br>
            Raise 'em up ... are you still down?<br>
            Raise 'em up ... are you still down?<br>
            <br>
            I'm gettin' high, so a nigga think, he touch the sky<br>
            Turn tough inside, in the rush to die<br>
            Livin' life as a thug, time to face the truth<br>
            What's goin' on with the wasted youth, please God<br>
            Come and save me, had to work with what ya gave me<br>
            And got a nigga goin' crazy<br>
            I can't read the signs<br>
            I'm blind, but a nigga know he need his nine<br>
            Cause times, they ain't what they used to be<br>
            Ain't a penitentiary built big enough for me<br>
            And my niggas on the streets, man, listen<br>
            Cause these ain't the old days<br>
            Ain't no way, I'mma bustin' my ass and gettin' no pay<br>
            It seems I can't find my focus and homie, I ain't paranoid<br>
            I seen the future and it's hopeless<br>
            Lord knows, it's hard on a young scrub<br>
            It seems I had less problems when I slung drugs<br>
            But since I'm tryin' lace, niggas with the game<br>
            Wanna see me locked in chains, tryin' to dirty up my name<br>
            And them same motherfuckers that was callin' me<br>
            Will be the first to turn their backs, when I'm fallin', see<br>
            I should have seen it from the jump, but now it's clear<br>
            This one nigga got the town in fear, but are you still down<br>
            <br>
            Raise 'em up ... are you still down?<br>
            Raise 'em up ... are you still down?<br>
            Raise 'em up ... are you still down?<br>
            Raise 'em up ... are you still down?<br>
            Raise 'em up ... are you still down?<br>
            <br>
            I wrote this for my critics and my enemies<br>
            Last year ya used to love me, huh, remember me<br>
            Now ya hate me with a passion, tryin' to get me stuck in the mix<br>
            I'm stayin' sharp, got no time for them tricks<br>
            And now they wonder if I'm goin' to jail<br>
            Just as well, cause my life on the streets - a livin' hell<br>
            And I can't sleep, they got my phone tapped<br>
            And mercy Lord, come get me 'fore they hurt me<br>
            Ran outta tears, and through the years couldn't change me<br>
            My daddy left me alone and so I'm angry<br>
            I never did nothin' wrong, my mama told me, "Baby, it's on!"<br>
            And now I'm hustlin' and bustlin' bones<br>
            Never said it came easy, I'm makin' cheese<br>
            Buyin' all the things on TV, and gettin' skeezed<br>
            Wish my homeboys could see me now<br>
            Little bad motherfucker runnin' wild through the town<br>
            Please tell me, are you still down?<br>
            <br>

        <h2>I Wonder If Heaven Got a Ghetto</h2><br>
        <p>I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto<br>
            I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto<br>
            I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto<br>
            I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto<br>
            <br>
            I was raised, the little young nigga doin' bad shit<br>
            Talk much shit, 'cause I never had shit<br>
            I could remember being whupped in class<br>
            And if I didn't pass, Mama whupped my ass<br>
            Was it my fault Papa didn't plan it out?<br>
            Broke out, left me to be the man of the house<br>
            I couldn't take it, had to make a profit<br>
            Found a block, got a Glock, and I clock grips<br>
            Makin' G's was my mission<br>
            Movin' enough of this shit to get my mama out the kitchen<br>
            And why must I sock a fella?<br>
            Just to live large like Rockefeller?<br>
            First you didn't give a fuck, but you're learnin' now<br>
            If you don't respect the town then we'll burn you down<br>
            Goddamn, it's a motherfuckin' riot<br>
            Black people on a rage, police, so don't try it<br>
            If you're not from the town then don't pass through<br>
            'Cause some O.G. fools might blast you<br>
            It ain't right, but it's long overdue<br>
            We can't have peace 'til the niggas get a piece too<br>
            I want G's so you label me a criminal<br>
            And if I die, I wonder if heaven got a ghetto<br>
            <br>
            I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto<br>
            I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto<br>
            I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto<br>
            I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto<br>
            <br>
            Here on Earth, tell me what's a black life worth?<br>
            A bottle of juice is no excuse, the truth hurts<br>
            And even when you take the shit<br>
            Move counties, get a lawyer, you can shake the shit<br>
            Ask Rodney, LaTasha, and many more<br>
            It's been going on for years, there's plenty more<br>
            When they ask me, "When will the violence cease?"<br>
            When your troops stop shootin' niggas down in the street<br>
            Niggas had enough time to make a difference<br>
            Bear witness, on our own business<br>
            Fuck the guard, 'cause it's hard tryin' to make ends meet<br>
            First we couldn't afford shit, now everything's free<br>
            so we loot, please don't shoot when you see<br>
            I'm takin' from them 'cause for years they would take from me<br>
            Now the tables have turned around<br>
            You didn't listen, until the niggas burned it down<br>
            And now Bush can't stop the hit<br>
            Predicted the shit in 2Pacalypse<br>
            And for once I was down with niggas<br>
            Felt good in the hood being around the niggas<br>
            Yeah, and for the first time everybody let go<br>
            And the streets is death row, I wonder if heaven got a ghetto<br>
            <br>
            I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto<br>
            I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto<br>
            I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto<br>
            (yeah), I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto<br>
            <br>
            I see no changes, all I see is racist faces<br>
            Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races<br>
            We under, I wonder what it take to make this<br>
            One better place, let's erase the wasted<br>
            Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right<br>
            'Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight<br>
            And only time we deal is when we kill each other<br>
            It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other<br>
            And though it seems heaven-sent<br>
            We ain't ready to have a black President<br>
            Huh, it ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact<br>
            The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks<br>
            I wake up in the mornin' and I ask myself<br>
            Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?<br>
            I'm tired of being poor and, even worse, I'm black<br>
            My stomach hurts, so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch<br>
            Cops give a damn about a negro<br>
            Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero<br>
            Mo' nigga, mo' nigga, mo' niggas<br>
            Rather I'd be dead than a po' nigga<br>
            Let the Lord judge the criminals<br>
            If I die, I wonder if heaven got a ghetto<br>
            <br>
            I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto<br>
            I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto<br>
            And I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto<br>
            I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto<br>
            I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto<br>
            I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto<br>
            I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto<br>
            (Just think if niggas decide to retaliate)<br>

        <h2>Nothing to Lose</h2><br>
        <p>The only way to change me is maybe blow my brains out<br>
            stuck in the middle of the game to get the pain out<br>
            Pray to my God everyday, but he don't listen<br>
            The poverty bothers me, but mama's working wonders in the kitchen<br>
            Listen! I can hear her crying in the bedroom<br>
            Praying for money but never think would she be dead soon<br>
            Am I wrong for wishing I was somewhere else<br>
            I'm thirteen, can't feed myself<br>
            Can I blame daddy cause he left me?<br>
            Wish he would've hugged me<br>
            Too much like him, so my mama don't love me<br>
            On my own at a early age, I'm getting paid<br>
            And I'm strapped, so I'll never be afraid<br>
            Where did I go astray?<br>
            I'm hanging in the back streets<br>
            Running with G's and dope fiends, will they jack me?<br>
            Can't turn back, my eyes on the prize<br>
            I got nothing to lose, everybody gotta die<br>
            say good-bye to the bad guy<br>
            That one, you fucked, when you passed by<br>
            Buck-buck from a Glock let the glass fly<br>
            Do or Die walk a mile in my shoes<br>
            Then you'd be crazy too<br>

            I thank the Lord for my many blessings<br>
            Though I'm stressing keep a vest for protection<br>
            From the barrel of a Smith and Wesson<br>
            And all my niggas in the pen, here we go again<br>
            Ain't nothing separating us from a MAC-10<br>
            Born in the ghetto as a hustler, older<br>
            Straight soldier, bucking at them bustas<br>
            No matter how you try, niggas never die<br>
            We just retaliate with hate, then we multiply<br>
            See me striking down the block hitting corners<br>
            Mobbing like a motherfucker, living like I wanna<br>
            Ain't no stopping at the red lights, I'm sideways<br>
            THUG LIFE, motherfucker, crime pays<br>
            Let the cops put they lights on, chase me, nigga<br>
            Zig-zagging through the freeway, race me, nigga<br>
            In a high speed chase with the law<br>
            the realest motherfucker that you ever saw<br>
            I'm living raw, til they bury me, don't worry me, I'm high<br>
            Living like I ain't afraid to die<br>
            And if you could walk a mile in my shoes<br>

            Ain't no escape from a deadly fate<br>
            and everyday there's a million black bodies put away<br>
            I'm starting to lose hope, it seems everybody's on dope<br>
            Mama told me to leave, cause she was broke<br>
            Sometimes I choke on the indo, creeping out the window<br>
            Alone, on my own, I'm a criminal<br>
            Got no love from the household<br>
            I'm out cold, on the streets screaming 'Motherfuck peace!'<br>
            I got nothing to lose, and something to prove, what do I do?<br>
            Live the THUG LIFE, nigga, stay true<br>
            I wonder when they kill me, is there a heaven for a real G?<br>
            Lord forgive me, if you feel me<br>
            Cause all my life I was dirt broke with no hope<br>
            Little skinny motherfucker wanting dough<br>
            I hated cutting suckers with my razor blade<br>
            but everyday it's a struggle to get major paid<br>
            Anyway, it's so hard on a nigga in this city, no pity<br>
            And ain't no love for the scrubs that be buying dime<br>

            Pack my nine til it's time to go to prison<br>
            As I'm bailin' down the block that I come from, still gotta pack a gun<br>
            Case some young motherfuckers wanna play dumb<br>
            I guess I live life forever jugglin'<br>
            But I'll be hustlin' 'til the early mornin' cause I'm strugglin'<br>
            Like drinkin' liquor make the money come quicker<br>
            Gettin' pages from my bitch it's time to dick her<br>
            I ain't in love with her, I just wanna be the one to hit her<br>
            Drop off and let the next nigga get her<br>
            That's the way it goes, it's time to shake a ho, make the dough<br>
            Break a ho when it's time to make some mo'<br>
            I keep my finger on the trigger of my Glock<br>
            Ridin' down the block lickin' shots at the punk-ass cops<br>
            And spittin' game through my mobile phone<br>

            <br>
            Well I roll with a crew of zoo niggas<br>
            They're quick to pull a nine when it's time do niggas<br>
            Comin' through like I'm two niggas, a true nigga fuck a Zig Zag<br>
            Roll me a blunt and pass that brew nigga<br>
            I'm drivin' drunk on the freeway, so take it ea-sy<br>
            Lookin' for a new face to skeeze me<br>
            Everybody's lookin' for a nut but I'm searchin' for the big bucks<br>
            Give a fuck, rather die than be stuck<br>
            In a one-room shack, and, kickin' back<br>
            Daydreamin' with the nine in my lap (huh)<br>
            So how's that from the mind of a Thug Nigga<br>
            Bought a fo'-five cause I heard that the slug's bigger<br>
            Figure the first motherfucker to jump'll find hisself<br>
            Gettin' swept off his feet by the pump<br>
            I put that on my moms, word to the motherfuckin' trigger<br>

            Make a phone call and be back to ball by lunchtime<br>
            So here we go, we in the inner city<br>
            I keep my hand on my gat and stay cool, my attitude is shitty<br>
            Niggas don't like me cause I'm makin' ends<br>
            Roll in a Benz and I blaze a blunt, cause I'm all in<br>
            And any nigga tryin' to take what I got'll<br>
            hafta deal with the sixteen-shot Glock (huh)<br>
            So here we go, I can't be faded<br>
            Happy in the motherfucker, finally made it<br>
            Got my money in my pocket, finger on the trigger<br>
            And I ain't takin' shit from no niggas<br>
            I'm just tryin to make some money right<br>
            Put some motherfuckin' food in my tummy right<br>
            I'm feelin' good like I'm supposed to, ready to ball<br>

            The penitentiary don't stop a nigga cause he's in jail<br>
            Hell I'm makin' more money on the street from here in a cell<br>

            Cause a real nigga love the law<br>
            What's raw is a nigga that's above the law<br>
            Keep pressin' your luck and get fucked, huh<br>
            Think a nigga don't know whassup 'cause he's locked up<br>
            But in the meantime, it's get swole get clean time<br>
            Concentrate on gettin' green time<br>
            And as the years go by, they forgot<br>
            About the small time soldier from the block, huh<br>
            To kill the crook they threw the book at me<br>
            Don't worry be nappy, don't even look happy<br>
            Put me in the hole, gave me cold cuts<br>
            Did push-ups until I swole up<br>
            And then they offer me a furlough<br>
            But what they don't know as soon as I get free I'm killin' five mo'<br>
            They asked me if I changed much<br>
            I told em 'Yeah' even though I'm still the same nut<br>
            They started askin' me questions about my brother<br>
            And makin' remarks about my mother, hmm<br>
            Wait a minute, hold up<br>
            Makin' jokes about my folks'll get yours blown up<br>
            They sent me back to the hole for what I told em<br>
            I guess he didn't believe me, so I showed him<br>
            He went home to find a tragedy<br>
            Nigga, that's what you get for tryin' to badger me<br>
            And anybody else that wanna sweat me<br>
            I'm already in jail so you punks can't get me<br>
            You better pray they never see me<br>
            Cause if they let me free, prepare for trouble on the streets<br>
            <br>
            When I get free, huh<br>

            Don't trip, baby <i>[*inhales*]</i><br>
            It'll get better... <i>[*coughing*]</i><br>

            Bet, it's all good, uh<br>
            <br>
            I never had much, ran with a bad bunch<br>
            Little skinny kid sneakin' weed in my bag lunch<br>
            And all through Junior High, we was just gettin' by<br>
            And drive-by's robbed my homies of their young lives<br>
            I never did cry, and even though I had pain in my heart<br>
            I was hopeless from the start<br>
            They couldn't tell me nothin', they all tried to help me<br>
            The marijuana had my mind gone, it wasn't healthy<br>
            I traveled places, caught cases, what a ill year<br>
            I felt the pain and the rain, but I'm still here<br>
            Never did like the police<br>
            Let the whole world know, now I gets no peace<br>
            'Cause they chasin' me down<br>
            And facin' me now, what do I do?<br>
            These things that a thug goes through<br>
            And still I rise, so keep your head up<br>
            And make your mind strong<br>
            It's a struggle every day, but you gotta hold on<br>
            <br>
            Hold on, be strong!<br>
            Hold on, be strong!<br>

            When it's on, it's on<br>

            There's never a good day, 'cause in my hood they<br>
            Let they AK's pump strays where the kids play<br>
            And every Halloween, check out the murder scene<br>
            Can't help but duplicate the violence seen on the screen<br>
            My homies dyin' before they get to see they birthdays<br>
            These is the worst days, sometimes it hurts to pray<br>
            And even God turned his back on the ghetto youth<br>
            I know that ain't the truth, sometimes I look for proof<br>
            I wonder if heaven got a ghetto, and if it does<br>
            Does it matter if you Blood or you Cuz?<br>
            Remember how it was?<br>
            The picnics and the parties in the projects<br>
            Small time drinkin', gettin' high with them armies<br>
            Just another knucklehead kid from the gutter<br>
            I'm dealin' with the madness, raised by a single mother<br>
            I'm tryin' to tell you when it's on<br>
            You gotta keep your head to the sky<br>
            And be strong, most of all, hold on<br>

            I know them ain't tears comin' down your face<br>
            Wipe your eyes<br>
            In this world, only the strong survive, you know?<br>
            Hehe, I know it's hard out there<br>
            Welfare, AIDS, earthquakes, muggings, car-jackings<br>
            Yeah, we got problems<br>
            But believe me when I tell you things always get better<br>
            God don't like ugly, and God don't like no quitters<br>
            You know what Billie Holiday said?<br>
            Bay-bee, God bless the child that can hold his own<br>
            You know? You got to stand strong<br>
            And when these bustas try to knock you out your place<br>
            You stand there to they face<br>
            Tell 'em "Hold on!", and be strong<br>

            This here is black, man<br>
            If you don't never learn nothin', learn one thing<br>
            It don't stop, 'til the casket drop<br>
            Thug for life... feel me?<br>
            All my homeboys and my homegirls, stay strong<br>
            When things get bad<br>
            Especially come the first and the fifteenth<br>
            Stay strong, and stay ballin', hold on<br>

            And little girls playin' double dutch<br>
            Still blush, cause she don't get in trouble much<br>
            It's uh, ponytails and barrettes<br>
            I gotta make it back home, before the sun decides to set<br>
            And little boys playin' stick ball, quick y'all<br>
            Get out the street before they hit y'all<br>
            And as I reminisce, I think about my ghetto bliss<br>
            And wonder how we came to this<br>
            I help an old lady across the street, the cost is free<br>
            I can't take what she offers me<br>
            And this is how the world could be<br>
            This is how the world should be<br>
            Feels good to be back on the streets<br>
            Cause I know they got love for me, nuttin but love<br>
            <br>

            <br>
            When I was young I used to want to be a dealer see<br>
            Cause the gold and cars they appealed to me<br>
            I saw our brothers gettin' rich slangin' crack to folks<br>
            And the square's gettin' big for these sack of dope<br>
            Started thinkin' bout a plan to get paid myself<br>
            So I made myself, raised myself<br>
            'Til the dealer on the block told me, "That ain't cool<br>
            You ain't meant to slang crack, you a rapper fool"<br>
            I got my game about women from a prostitute<br>
            And way back used to rap on the block for loot<br>
            I tried to make my way legit, haha<br>
            But it was hard, cause rhymes don't pay the rent<br>
            And uhh, it was funny how I copped out<br>
            I couldn't make it in school, so finally I dropped out<br>
            My family on welfare<br>
            I'm steady thinkin', since don't nobody else care<br>
            I'm out here on my own<br>
            At least in jail I have a meal and I wouldn't be alone<br>
            I'm feelin' like a waste, tears rollin' down my face<br>
            Cause my life is filled with hate<br>
            Until I looked around me<br>
            I saw nuttin but family, straight up down for me<br>
            Panthers, Pimps, Pushers and Thugs<br>
            Hey yo, that's my family tree, I got nuttin but love<br>

        <h2>16 On Death Row</h2><br>
        <p>Death Row, that's where mothafuckas is endin' up<br>
            <br>
            Dear mama, I'm caught up in this sickness<br>
            I robbed my adversaries but slipped and left a witness<br>
            Wonder if they'll catch me, or will this nigga snitch?<br>
            Should I shoot his bitch or make the nigga rich<br>
            Don't wanna commit murder, but damn, they got me trapped<br>
            Hawkin' while I'm walkin' and talkin' behind my back<br>
            I'm kind of schizophrenic, I'm in this shit to win it<br>
            'Cause life's a Wheel of Fortune, here's my chance to spin it<br>
            Got no time for cops, who trip and try to catch me<br>
            Too fuckin' trigger-happy to let them suckers snatch me<br>
            Niggas gettin' jealous, tryin' to find my stash<br>
            Whip out the 9, now <i>[?]</i> pump your ass<br>
            Peter picked a pepper, but I can pick a punk<br>
            Snatched him like a bitch and threw him in the trunk<br>
            The punk thought I was bluffin', but swear I'm nothin' nice<br>
            Before I take your life, first wrestle with these mites<br>
            I listened to his screams, until he went insane<br>
            I guess the little mites had finally found his brain<br>
            New Rovers pull me over, I'm sentenced to the pen<br>
            Remember that little bird? He snitched and told a friend<br>
            It's trouble on my mind, I'm with the old-timers<br>
            And fuck five-0! Blaow, blaow! Turn 'em into forty-niners<br>
            <br>
            Bye bye, I was never meant to live<br>
            Can't be positive when the ghetto's where you live<br>
            Bye bye, I was never meant to be<br>
            Livin' like a thief, runnin' through the streets<br>
            Bye bye, and I got no place to go<br>
            Where they find me; 16 on Death Row<br>
            <br>
            Dear mama, these cops don't understand me<br>
            I turned to a life of crime, 'cause I came from a broken family<br>
            My uncle used to touch me, I never told you that<br>
            Scared what you might do, I couldn't hold you back<br>
            I kept it deep inside, I done let it fuel my anger<br>
            I'm down for all my homies, no mercy for a stranger<br>
            The brother in my cell is 16 as well<br>
            It's hard to adapt when you're black<br>
            And you're trapped in a living hell<br>
            I shouldn't have let him catch me<br>
            Instead of livin' sad in jail I could've died free and happy<br>
            And my cellmate's raped on the norm<br>
            And passed around the dorm<br>
            You can hear his asshole gettin' torn<br>
            They made me an animal, can't sleep<br>
            Instead of countin' sheep, niggas countin' cannibals<br>
            And that's how it is in the pen<br>
            Turn old and cold, and your soul is your best friend<br>
            My mama, pray for me; tell the Lord to make way for me<br>
            Prepare any day for me (Why?)<br>
            'Cause when they come for me they find a struggler<br>
            To the death I take the breath from your jugular<br>
            The trick is to never lose hope<br>
            I found my buddy hangin' dead from a rope; 16 on Death Row<br>
            <br>
            Bye bye, I was never meant to live<br>
            Can't be positive when the ghetto's where you live<br>
            Bye bye, I was never meant to be<br>
            Livin' like a thief, runnin' through the streets<br>
            Bye bye, and I got no place to go<br>
            Where they find me; 16 on Death Row<br>
            <br>
            Dear mama, they sentenced me to death<br>
            Today's my final day, I'm countin' every breath<br>
            I'm bitter 'cause I'm dying, so much I haven't seen<br>
            I know you never dreamed your baby would be dead at 16<br>
            I got beef with a sick society<br>
            That doesn't give a shit<br>
            And they too quick to say goodbye to me<br>
            They tell me the preacher's there for me<br>
            He's a crook with a book<br>
            That mothafucka never cared for me<br>
            He's only here to be sure I don't drop a dime to God<br>
            About the crimes he's committin' on the poor<br>
            And how can these people judge me?<br>
            They ain't my peers, and in all these years<br>
            They ain't never love me<br>
            I never got to be a man, must be part of some big plan<br>
            To keep a nigga in the state pen<br>
            And to my homies out buryin' mothafuckas<br>
            Steer clear of these Aryan mothafuckas<br>
            'Cause once they got you locked up<br>
            They got you trapped, you're better off gettin' shot up<br>
            I'm convinced self-defense is the way<br>
            Please, stay strapped, pack a gat every day<br>
            I wish I would've known while I was out there<br>
            Now I'm straight headin' for the chair<br>
            <br>
            Bye bye, I was never meant to live<br>
            Can't be positive when the ghetto's where you live<br>
            Bye bye, I was never meant to be<br>

            I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto<br>
            <br>
            I was raised, the little young nigga doin' bad shit<br>
            Talk much shit, 'cause I never had shit<br>
            I could remember being whupped in class<br>
            And if I didn't pass, Mama whupped my ass<br>
            Was it my fault Papa didn't plan it out?<br>
            Broke out, left me to be the man of the house<br>
            I couldn't take it, had to make a profit<br>
            Found a block, got a Glock, and I clock grips<br>
            Makin' G's was my mission<br>
            Movin' enough of this shit to get my mama out the kitchen<br>
            And why must I sock a fella?<br>
            Just to live large like Rockefeller?<br>
            First you didn't give a fuck, but you're learnin' now<br>
            If you don't respect the town then we'll burn you down<br>
            Goddamn, it's a motherfuckin' riot<br>
            Black people on a rage, police, so don't try it<br>
            If you're not from the town then don't pass through<br>
            'Cause some O.G. fools might blast you<br>
            It ain't right, but it's long overdue<br>
            We can't have peace 'til the niggas get a piece too<br>
            I want G's so you label me a criminal<br>
            And if I die, I wonder if heaven got a ghetto<br>

            I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto<br>
            <br>
            Here on Earth, tell me what's a black life worth?<br>
            A bottle of juice is no excuse, the truth hurts<br>
            And even when you take the shit<br>
            Move counties, get a lawyer, you can shake the shit<br>
            Ask Rodney, LaTasha, and many more<br>
            It's been going on for years, there's plenty more<br>
            When they ask me, "When will the violence cease?"<br>
            When your troops stop shootin' niggas down in the street<br>
            Niggas had enough time to make a difference<br>
            Bear witness, on our own business<br>
            Fuck the guard, 'cause it's hard tryin' to make ends meet<br>
            First we couldn't afford shit, now everything's free<br>
            so we loot, please don't shoot when you see<br>
            I'm takin' from them 'cause for years they would take from me<br>
            Now the tables have turned around<br>
            You didn't listen, until the niggas burned it down<br>
            And now Bush can't stop the hit<br>
            Predicted the shit in 2Pacalypse<br>
            And for once I was down with niggas<br>
            Felt good in the hood being around the niggas<br>
            Yeah, and for the first time everybody let go<br>
            And the streets is death row, I wonder if heaven got a ghetto<br>

            (yeah), I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto<br>
            <br>
            I see no changes, all I see is racist faces<br>
            Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races<br>
            We under, I wonder what it take to make this<br>
            One better place, let's erase the wasted<br>
            Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right<br>
            'Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight<br>
            And only time we deal is when we kill each other<br>
            It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other<br>
            And though it seems heaven-sent<br>
            We ain't ready to have a black President<br>
            Huh, it ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact<br>
            The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks<br>
            I wake up in the mornin' and I ask myself<br>
            Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?<br>
            I'm tired of being poor and, even worse, I'm black<br>
            My stomach hurts, so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch<br>
            Cops give a damn about a negro<br>
            Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero<br>
            Mo' nigga, mo' nigga, mo' niggas<br>
            Rather I'd be dead than a po' nigga<br>
            Let the Lord judge the criminals<br>

            Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street<br>
            There'll be trouble when they see me<br>

            I heard a snicker a laugh, I take a look at the evening news<br>

            These motherfuckers tryin' to dirty up my name, but<br>

            My foes be on a mission, tryin' to do me in<br>
            Fuck 'em I'm out to get out, they all thought<br>
            I blow up like a gauge, and in a rage, blow they balls off<br>
            Why are you niggas tryin' to test me trick?<br>
            And be the first ones to snitch to arrest me bitch<br>
            My Main thang with a nigga meal ticket only if you with the real<br>

            Use the lessons that I learned in jail<br>
            Rule one: fuck a busta he can burn in Hell<br>
            Now I'm workin' with connects that I got in the pen<br>

            If we make it then I'm takin' it to Hell<br>

            Locked in jail, I couldn't touch her so I planned, in misery<br>

        <h2>Only Fear of Death</h2><br>
        <p>Pssst... psssssst... ayo<br>
            Are you afraid to die, or do you wanna live forever?<br>
            Tell me, which one?<br>
            <br>
            They wanna bury me, I'm worried -- I'm losin' my mind<br>
            Look down the barrel of my 9, and my vision's blurry<br>
            Fallin' to pieces, am I guilty? I pray to the Lord<br>
            But he ignores me, unfortunately, ‘cause I'm guilty<br>
            Show me a miracle, I'm hopeless<br>
            I'm chokin' off marijuana smoke<br>
            With every toke it's like I'm losin' focus<br>
            Fallin' to sleep while I'm at service, when will I die?<br>
            Forever paranoid and nervous, because I'm high<br>
            Don't mention funerals, I'm stressin' and goin' nutty<br>
            And reminiscin' 'bout them niggas that murdered my buddy<br>
            I wonder: When will I be happy? Ain't nothin' funny<br>
            Flashbacks of bustin' caps, anything for money<br>
            Where am I goin'? I discovered, can't nothin' save me<br>
            My next door neighbor's havin' convo with undercovers<br>
            Put a surprise in the mailbox, hope she get it<br>
            Happy birthday, bitch, you know you shouldn't have did it<br>
            Everybody's dyin', am I next? Who can I trust?<br>
            Will they be G's, and they look at me before they bust?<br>
            Or will they kill me while I'm sleepin'?<br>
            Two to the head while I'm in bed<br>
            Leakin' blood on my satin sheets<br>
            Is there a heaven for a baller?<br>
            I'm gettin' suspicious of this bitch<br>
            The line's busy everytime I call her<br>
            Now she's tellin' me to visit, who else is home?<br>
            I check the house before I bone, so we all alone<br>
            After I nut I hit the highway -- see ya later!<br>
            To all the players, watch the fly way a nigga played her<br>
            The bitch is tellin' all her homies<br>
            That I can fuck her like no other<br>
            Now them other bitches wanna bone me<br>
            I'm under pressure, gettin' drunk, somebody help me<br>
            I drink a fifth of Hennessy, I don't think it's healthy<br>
            I see my enemies, they creepin', don't make me blast<br>
            I watch the 5-0's roll, the motherfuckers pass<br>
            By me like they know me, smilin' as they laugh<br>
            I put up my middle finger, then I dash<br>
            Niggas don't like me, ‘cause I'm thuggin'<br>
            And every day I'm a hustler lookin' to get paid<br>
            They wanna bury me, I'm worried -- no need to lie<br>
            I pray to God I don't scream when it's time to fry<br>
            Nowhere to rest, I'm losin' homies -- ain't that a bitch?<br>
            When I was rich I had clout, now a nigga's lonely<br>
            I put the pistol to my head, and say a prayer<br>
            I see visions of me dead, Lord, are you there?<br>
            Then tell me, am I lost? ‘Cause I'm lonely<br>
            I thought I had friends, but in the end a nigga dies lonely<br>
            Nowhere to run, I'm in terror, and no one cares<br>
            A closed casket at my funeral and no one's there<br>
            Is there a future for a killer? I change my ways<br>
            But still that don't promise me the next day<br>
            So I stay thuggin' with a passion, forever blastin'<br>
            I'm bustin' on these motherfuckers in my madness<br>
            They wonder if I'm hellbound<br>
            Well, Hell can't be worse than this, ‘cause I'm in Hell now<br>
            Don't make me hurt you, I don't want to, but I will<br>
            Seen motherfuckers killed over phone bills<br>
            Never will I die, I'll be back<br>
            Reincarnated as a motherfuckin' MAC<br>
            -11, ‘cause in Heaven there's no shortage on G's<br>
            I'm tellin' you now: You motherfuckers don't know me<br>
            <br>

            <br>
            Hahaha, I ain't scared to die<br>
            I ain't scared to die<br>
            To my homies in Heaven: I ain't scared to die<br>
            Do you wanna live forever? Are you scared to die?<br>
            Or will you scream when you fry?<br>
            I don't fear death<br>
