        <h2>Intro</h2><br>
        <p><b>[Male Reporter]</b><br>
            At 12:25 AM Wednesday, 2Pac was on his way into a time square building to record at an eight-floor studio with another rapper. But in the lobby, Shakur was shot several times, including two graze wounds to the head. 2Pac's lawyers said the attack appeared to be a setup
            <br><br>
            <b>[Female Reporter]</b><br>
            Against doctors orders, 2Pac Shakur checked himself out of the hospital less than 24 hours after being shot 5 times on the way into a Manhattan recording studio
            <br><br>
            <b>[Male Reporter]</b><br>
            2Pac Shakur secures one clean legal victory this year, as he's dismissed of assault charges brought against him when he allegedly shot at two off-duty Atlantic cops on Halloween last year. The case was dismissed due to insufficient evidence
            <br><br>
            <b>[Male Reporter]</b><br>
            More controvery surrounding 2Pac Shakur ...
            <br><br>
            <b>[Female Reporter]</b><br>
            Meanwhile, in 2Pac news, at about 6:45 tonight, Shakur may have lowered his own chances of surviving the attack by checking himself out of the hospital that probably saved his life
            <br><br>
            <b>[Male Reporter]</b><br>
            2Pac Shakur checked into the Metropolitan Hospital yesterday under an assumed name. His lawyers said that he had connections, but wouldn't say what kind, that could provide top notch security for the injured rap star
            <br><br>
            <b>[Female Reporter]</b><br>
            Shakur underwent surgery today ...
            <br><br>
            <b>[Male Reporter]</b><br>
            The shooting of 2Pac Shakur here in New York City once again underscores the violence that has surrounded this man since he shot to superstardom in the world of music and entertainment</p>

            <br>
            They say pussy and paper is poetry, power and pistols<br>
            Plotting on murdering motherfuckers 'fore they get you<br>
            Picturing pitiful punk niggas copping pleas<br>
            Puffing weed as I position myself to clock G's<br>
            My enemies scatter in suicidal situations<br>
            Never to witness the wicked shit that they was facin'<br>
            Pockets is packed with presidents, pursue your riches<br>
            Evading the playa hating tricks while hitting switches<br>
            Bitches is bad-mouth, ‘cause brawling motherfuckers is bold<br>
            But charge them hoes; the game should be sold<br>
            I'm sick of psychotic society, somebody save me<br>
            Addicted to drama, so even mama couldn't raise me<br>
            Even the preacher and all my teachers couldn't reach me<br>
            I run in the streets and puffing weed with my peeps<br>
            I'm duckin' the cops, I hit the weed as I'm clutchin' my Glock<br>
            Niggas is hot when I hit the block; what if I die tonight?<br>

            Tonight's the night I get in some shit<br>
            <br>
            Polish your pistols, prepare for battle, pass the pump<br>
            When I get to poppin', niggas is droppin' then they done<br>
            Calling the coroner, come collect the fucking corpse<br>
            He got hit by a killer, preoccupied with being boss<br>
            Revenge is the method<br>
            Whenever steppin', keep a weapon close<br>
            Adversaries are overdosed over deadly notes<br>
            Jealous niggas and broke bitches equal packed jails<br>
            Hit the block and fill your pockets, making crack sales<br>
            Picture perfection, pursuing paper with a passion<br>
            Visions of prisons for all the pussies that I blasted<br>
            Running with criminals individuals with no remorse<br>
            Try to stop me, my pistol posse's using deadly force<br>
            In my brain all I can think about is fame<br>
            The police know my name<br>
            A different game, ain't a thing changed<br>
            I'm seeing cemetery photos of my peers<br>

            Plotting on murdering motherfuckers 'fore they get you<br>
            Pray to the Heaven's, .357's to the sky<br>
            And I hope I'm forgiven for thug livin' when I die<br>
            I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto for thug niggas<br>
            A stress free life and a spot for drug dealers<br>
            Pissing while practicing how to pimp and be a playa<br>
            Overdose of a dick while drinking liquor when I lay her<br>
            Pistol whippin' these simps, for being petrified and lame<br>
            Disrespecting the game, praying for punishment and pain<br>
            Going insane, never die, I live eternal, who shall I fear?<br>
            Don't shed a tear for me, nigga, I ain't happy here<br>
            I hope they bury me and send me to my rest<br>
            Headlines reading 'Murdered to death', my last breath<br>
            Take a look, picture a crook on his last stand<br>

            The message I stress: to make it stop, study your lessons<br>
            Don't settle for less, even the genius asks his questions<br>
            Be grateful for blessings, don't ever change, keep your essence<br>

            Always do your best, don't let the pressure make you panic<br>
            And when you get stranded<br>
            And things don't go the way you planned it<br>
            Dreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference<br>
            Politicians are hypocrites, they don't wanna listen<br>

        <h2>So Many Tears</h2><br>
        <p>I shall not fear no man but God<br>
            Though I walk through the valley of death<br>
            I shed so many tears<br>
            If I should die before I wake<br>
            Please God walk with me<br>
            Grab a nigga and take me to Heaven<br>
            <br>
            Back in elementary, I thrived on misery<br>
            Left me alone I grew up amongst a dying breed<br>
            Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest<br>
            Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest<br>
            Tell me can you feel me<br>
            I'm not living in the past, you wanna last?<br>
            Be the first to blast Remember Kato<br>
            No longer with us; he's deceased<br>
            Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets, now rest in peace<br>
            Is there heaven for a G? Remember me<br>
            So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears<br>
            <br>
            I! I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears...<br>
            Lord! I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears<br>
            <br>
            Now that I'm struggling in this business, by any means<br>
            Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen<br>
            And fuck the world cause I'm cursed, I'm having visions<br>
            Of leaving here in a hearse, God can you feel me?<br>
            Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain<br>
            Show me some happiness again, I'm going blind<br>
            I spend my time in this cell, ain't living well<br>
            I know my destiny is Hell. Where did I fail?<br>
            My life is in denial and when I die<br>
            Baptized in eternal fire, shed so many tears<br>
            <br>
            Lord! I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears...<br>
            Lord! I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears<br>
            <br>
            Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears<br>
            I'm suicidal so don't stand near me<br>
            My every move is a calculated step, to bring me closer<br>
            To embrace an early death, now there's nothing left<br>
            There was no mercy on the streets, I couldn't rest<br>
            I'm barely standing, bout to go to pieces, screamin' peace<br>
            And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it<br>
            I had my mind full of demons trying to break free<br>
            They planted seeds and they hatched, sparking the flame<br>
            Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game<br>
            No memories, just a misery<br>
            Painting a picture of my enemies killing me, in my sleep<br>
            Will I survive 'til the mornin' to see the sun<br>
            Please Lord forgive me for my sins, cause here I come<br>
            <br>
            Lord! (God!), I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears...<br>
            God! I lost so many peers<br>
            <br>
            And Lord knows I tried, been a witness to homicide<br>
            Seen drive-bys takin' lives, little kids die<br>
            Wonder why as I walk by<br>
            Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, getting high<br>
            This ain't the life for me, I wanna change<br>
            But ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game<br>
            I'm trapped inside a maze<br>
            See this Tanqueray influenced me to getting crazy<br>
            Disillusioned lately, I've been really wanting babies<br>
            So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady<br>
            Don't trust my lady cause she's a product of this poison<br>
            I'm hearing noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys, can't take no more<br>
            I'm fallin' to the floor; beggin' for the Lord to let me in<br>
            To Heaven's door -- shed so many tears<br>
            <br>
            Lord! lost so many peers, and shed so many tears...<br>
            I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears...<br>
            Lord! I suffered many years, and shed so many tears...<br>
            God! I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears</p>

            And all other lil' Young Niggas that's in a rush to be gangstas<br>
            <br>
            As a Young nigga, I'm almost runnin' in the wind<br>
            Give anything, to be that innocent again, when I was ten<br>
            I didn't bang but I was hangin' with the homies<br>
            'Til them niggas started slangin', now they don't know me<br>
            I got my hustle on, learned to ignore what couldn't pay me<br>
            Lately I've been tryin' to make a mill-ion, can you blame me?<br>
            With that jealousy they need to miss me, don't sweat me<br>
            If them cowards really want me, come get me, and even I<br>
            Someday will die but I'm cautious, I'm fin' to ride<br>

            Stop through the hood, grab the young thugs<br>
            And I can't help but reminisce back when we slung drugs, though it's bad<br>
            But all we had was our hopes and dreams<br>
            Couldn't see unless we learned to slang dope to fiends<br>

            My neighborhood was full of drive-bys, couldn't survive<br>
            All our homies livin' short lives, I couldn't cry<br>
            Told my momma if I did die, just put a blunt in my casket<br>

            <br>
            I smoke a blunt to take the pain out<br>
            And if I wasn't high, I'd probably try to blow my brains out<br>
            I'm hopeless, they should've killed me as a baby<br>
            And now they got me trapped in the storm, I'm goin' crazy<br>
            Forgive me; they wanna see me in my casket<br>
            And if I don't blast I'll be the victim of them bastards<br>
            I'm losin' hope, they got me stressin', can the Lord forgive me<br>
            Got the spirit of a thug in me<br>
            Another sip of that drink, this Hennessey got me queasy<br>
            Don't wanna hurl, young nigga take it easy<br>
            Picture your dreams on a triple beam, and it seems<br>
            Don't underestimate the power of a fiend<br>

        <h2>Dear Mama</h2><br>
        <p><i>[2pac:]</i><br>
            You are appreciated<br>
            When I was young, me and my mama had beef<br>
            17 years old, kicked out on the streets<br>
            Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face<br>
            Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place<br>
            Suspended from school<br>
            And scared to go home, I was a fool<br>
            With the big boys breaking all the rules<br>
            I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years<br>
            We was poorer than the other little kids<br>
            And even though we had different daddies, the same drama<br>
            When things went wrong we'd blame mama<br>
            I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell<br>
            Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell<br>
            And who'd think in elementary, hey<br>
            I'd see the penitentiary one day?<br>
            And running from the police, that's right<br>
            Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside<br>
            And even as a crack fiend, mama<br>
            You always was a black queen, mama<br>
            I finally understand<br>
            For a woman it ain't easy trying to raise a man<br>
            You always was committed<br>
            A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it<br>
            There's no way I can pay you back, but the plan<br>
            Is to show you that I understand; you are appreciated<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Reggie Green and "Sweet Franklin" (2Pac):]</i><br>
            Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)<br>
            Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)<br>
            Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?<br>

            Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair<br>
            No love from my daddy, 'cause the coward wasn't there<br>
            He passed away and I didn't cry, 'cause my anger<br>
            wouldn't let me feel for a stranger<br>
            They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along<br>
            I was looking for a father he was gone<br>
            I hung around with the thugs<br>
            And even though they sold drugs<br>
            They showed a young brother love<br>
            I moved out and started really hangin'<br>
            I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'<br>
            I ain't guilty, 'cause even though I sell rocks<br>
            It feels good putting money in your mailbox<br>
            I love paying rent when the rent is due<br>
            I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you<br>
            'Cause when I was low you was there for me<br>
            And never left me alone, because you cared for me<br>
            And I could see you coming home after work late<br>
            You're in the kitchen, trying to fix us a hot plate<br>
            You just working with the scraps you was given<br>
            And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'<br>
            But now the road got rough, you're alone<br>
            You're trying to raise two bad kids on your own<br>
            And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan<br>
            Is to show you that I understand; you are appreciated<br>

            <i>[Reggie Green and "Sweet Franklin" (2Pac):]</i><br>
            Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)<br>
            Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)<br>

            <i>[2pac:]</i><br>
            Pour out some liquor and I reminisce<br>
            'Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama<br>
            And when it seems that I'm hopeless<br>
            You say the words that can get me back in focus<br>
            When I was sick as a little kid<br>
            To keep me happy, there's no limit to the things you did<br>
            And all my childhood memories<br>
            Are full of all the sweet things you did for me<br>
            And even though I act crazy<br>
            I gotta thank the Lord that you made me<br>
            There are no words that can express how I feel<br>
            You never kept a secret, always stayed real<br>
            And I appreciate how you raised me<br>
            And all the extra love that you gave me<br>
            I wish I could take the pain away<br>
            If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day<br>
            Everything will be alright if you hold on<br>
            It's a struggle everyday, gotta roll on<br>
            And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan<br>
            Is to show you that I understand; you are appreciated<br>

            Phone calls from my niggas on the, other side<br>
            Two childhood friends just died, I couldn't cry<br>
            A damn shame, when will we ever change?<br>
            And what remains from a twelve gauge to the brain?<br>
            Arguments with my Boo, it's true<br>
            I spend mo' time with my niggas than I do with you<br>
            But everywhere it's the same thang, that's the game<br>
            I'll be damned if a thang changed, fuck the fame<br>
            I'll be hustlin' to make a mill-ion<br>

            Whassup? It's 2Pac. Can you get away?<br>
            Let me come swoop you up<br>
            (You know I got a man)<br>
            I know you got a man, but he ain't gon' mind if I take you out<br>
            (Of course he gon' mind)<br>
            Let me take you to lunch, I'll have you back before he even get home, before anybody see<br>
            (I can't, he ain't gon' let me<br>
            Aww c'mon! Please...<br>
            (Nah)<br>
            Oh aight – what's wrong with your eye?<br>
            Why you got on glasses?<br>
            <br>
            <i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            Ever since I met ya I could peep the pressure<br>
            It's like your man don't understand, all he does is stress ya<br>
            I can see your state of misery from the introduction<br>
            Ain't 'bout no suckin' and touchin', just harmless discussion<br>
            Maybe we can see a better way, find a brighter day<br>
            Late night phone conversations – would that be OK?<br>
            I don't wanna take up all your time, be the next in line<br>
            Tell me your size, let me find you things with you in mind<br>
            I can see you're cautious and I'm careful not to scare you<br>
            The anticipation of love makin'<br>
            Got you shakin' when I'm standin' near you<br>
            News of precision will prepare ya<br>
            In case you get scared, just ask the man in the mirror<br>
            Now the picture's gettin' clearer<br>
            All he does is hit you hard<br>
            I tell you to leave him, and you tell me keep my faith in God<br>
            I don't understand, I just wanna bring ya home<br>
            I wonder should I leave you alone<br>
            And find a woman of my own<br>
            All the homies tell me that you don't deserve it<br>
            I contemplate – but in my heart I know you worth it<br>
            Tell me, can you get away?<br>
            <br>

            LL, Raising Hell, but, that didn't last<br>
            Eric B. &amp; Rakim was, the shit to me<br>
            I flip to see a Doug E. Fresh show, with Ricky D<br>
            and Red Alert was puttin in work, with Chuck Chill<br>
            Had my homies on the hill getting ill, when shit was real<br>
            Went out to steal. Remember Raw, with Daddy Kane?!<br>
            when De La Soul was puttin Potholes in the game<br>
            I can't explain how it was, Whodini<br>

            Them block parties in the projects, and on my block<br>
            You diggy don't stop, sippin on that Private Stock<br>
            Through my speaker Queen Latifah, and MC Lyte<br>
            Listen to Treach, KRS to get me through the night<br>
            With T La Rock and Mantronix, to Stetsasonic<br>

            A killer crease inside my Lee's when I hit the streets<br>
            I'm playing skelly, Ringolevio, or catch a kiss<br>
            Before the homies in my hood learned to smack a bitch<br>
            I remember. Way back, the weak weed they had<br>
            Too many seeds in the trey bag<br>
            I'm on the train headin uptown, freestyling<br>
            With some wild kids from Bucktown, profiling<br>
            Cus the hoochies was starin, thinking, "What them niggas wearing?"<br>
            I'm wondering if that's her hair, I remember<br>
            Stickball, humpin hoochies on the wall<br>
            Or taking leaks on the steps, stinking up the hall<br>
            Through my childhood, wild as a juvenile<br>
            A young nigga tryin to stay away from Rikers Isle<br>
            Me and my homies breakin nights, tryin to keep it true<br>
            Out on the roof sipping 90 proof, ain't nuttin like the old school<br>

            Jekyll and Hyde, LL when he Rocks the Bells<br>
            Forget the TV, I'd rather hit the streets and do graffiti<br>

            Remember motherfuckers used to go, "Is Brooklyn in the house?"<br>
            And motherfuckers would lose they God Damn Mind!<br>
            That's the old school to me; that's what I'm sayin (Super, Sperm)<br>

            Back in the motherfucking old school nigga<br>

        <p><i>[2Pac (RahRah):]</i><br>
            That's right nigga you gotta get your papers in this motherfucker<br>
            I ain't mad at ya at all (damn)<br>
            Aiyyo, what the fuck you wanna be when you grow up RahRah?<br>
            (Nigga, is you stupid, I wanna be a motherfuckin' Outlaw)<br>
            That's right nigga, hahaha. Housin' these hoes, you feel me?<br>
            (Aight, you know what I'm sayin'?)<br>
            You got to do that shit, keepin' it real nigga or what?<br>
            (Keepin' it real!)<br>
            How old are you nigga?<br>
            (I'm eleven)<br>
            <br>
            <i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            Cause all I see is, murder murder, my mind state<br>
            Preoccupied with homicide, tryin' to survive through this crime rate<br>
            Dead bodies at block parties, those unlucky bastards<br>
            Gunfire now they require many closed caskets<br>
            Who can you blame? It's insane what we been through<br>
            Witnessin' evil that these men do, bitches sin too<br>
            In fact they be the reasons niggas get to bleedin'<br>
            Pull 'n' fuckin' fire when I leave 'em, you shoulda seen 'em<br>
            Hostile hoes catch elbows (beotch!) negroes disposed of<br>
            and snitches get dealt with, with no love<br>
            Body bags of adversaries that I had to bury<br>
            I broke the law and they jaw, all in the same flurry<br>
            But never worry, they'll remember me through history<br>
            Causin' motherfuckers to bleed, they'll label me a<br>
            <br>
            Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw (They came in to sin)<br>
            Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw (Dear God, I wonder could you save me?)<br>
            <br>
            <i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            Before I close my eyes I fantasize I'm livin' well<br>
            When I awake and realize I'm just a prisoner in hell<br>
            Just as well, cause in my cell I'm keepin' pictures of these bastards<br>
            Exercisin', visualizin', everyone inside a casket<br>
            Picture me blasted, surrounded by niggas in masks<br>
            Sent with the task to harass and murder my ass<br>
            Will I last? Heaven or Hell? Freedom or jail?<br>
            Shit's hard, who can you tell? And if we fail?<br>
            High speeds, and Thai weed on the freeway<br>
            When will they learn to take it easy? Uh<br>
            Drive-by's and niggas die, murder without a motive<br>
            By makin' motherfuckers fry<br>
            Got me runnin' from these coward-ass crooked-ass cops<br>
            Helicopters tryna hover over niggas 'til we drop<br>
            Got no time for the courts, my only thought is open fire<br>
            Hit the district attorney, but fuck that bitch, cause she's a liar<br>
            Now it's time to expire, I see the judge, spray the bitch<br>
            "Motherfuckers is crooked," is what I scream, and hit the fence<br>
            I commence to get wicked, spittin' rounds as the plot thickens<br>
            Never missin', an early grave is my only mission<br>
            If I die, never worry, bury me beside my four-five<br>
            May God forgive me, I was high, label me a<br>
            <br>
            Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw (They came in to sin)<br>

            <i>[Kadafi:]</i><br>
            Society lied to me, I ain't never gonna try to be<br>
            My mob'll be doin' robberies, and stickups on these wannabe's<br>
            I witnessed niggas lose they chest<br>
            For ordinary reasons niggas bodies put to rest<br>
            <i>[Kastro:]</i><br>
            So I just... swallow my Beck's and holla, "Fuck 'em!"<br>
            And if I'm next... just let a nigga step with somethin'<br>
            I ain't fearin' nuttin'<br>
            <i>[EDI Amin (Kastro):]</i><br>
            Young and thuggin', prepared for bustin' if that's my destiny<br>
            Ready for whatever, see you niggas can't get the best of me<br>
            (hold me down) Definitely no need for askin'<br>
            (now he mashin') Top speed (smokin' weed) laughin' (biotch!)<br>
            <i>[Napoleon:]</i><br>
            Cause when I bust 'em they gonna shiver, the killers cry<br>
            Soldiers got bodies floatin' in the river, what is they sayin'?<br>
            Talkin' 'bout prayin'<br>
            <i>[Kadafi:]</i><br>
            They need to stop, that ain't gon' help<br>
            These niggas sprayin' up my block<br>
            <i>[Napolean:]</i><br>
            Tryin' to take my wealth<br>
            <br>

            Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw (Dear God, I wonder could you save me?)<br>
