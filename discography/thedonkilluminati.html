        <h2>Intro/Bomb First (My Second Reply)</h2><br>
        <p><i>[*crowd noise*]</i><br>
            <br>
            <i>[Press release:]</i><br>
            In today's music news: The ever-controversial 2Pac Shakur has just released another album under the alias "Makaveli".<br>
            Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artists' street dates in fear of a wipeout in retail interchart movement.<br>
            Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character of not only Mr. Shakur, but of Death Row Records as well.<br>
            Nas, the alleged ring leader, is furious at 2Pac—excuse me–Makaveli's verbal assault on Mobb Sleep, Notorious P.I.G., and several other New York rappers.<br>
            Jay Z, from "Hawaiian Sophie" fame, Big Little whatever and several other corny sounding motherfuckers are understandably shaken up by this release.<br>
            The question everybody wants to know is:<br>
            Why'd they get this nigga started? 2Pac–rather Makaveli–was not available for comment, but released this statement:<br>
            <br>
            <i>[2Pac talking:]</i><br>
            It's not about East or West<br>
            It's about niggas and bitches, power and money, riders and punks – which side are you on?<br>
            <br>
            <i>[*gunshots followed by several encroaching footsteps*]</i><br>
            <br>
            These niggas is still fucking talking?<br>
            You niggas still breathing? Fucking roaches, aight<br>

            Money-making plans, pistol close at hand, swollen pockets<br>

            See me ride! Located worldwide like the art of graffiti<br>
            I think I'm tougher than Nitti, my attitude is shitty<br>

            Cut 'em down, to hell is where we send 'em<br>
            My whole team; trained to explode, ride or die<br>
            Murder motherfuckers lyrically and I'm not gonna cry<br>

            Two big pits, I call them "my bitch-nigga eaters"<br>
            And not a whimper until I'm gone<br>
            Thug Life running through my veins, so I'm strong<br>
            Bye bye bye, let's get high and ride<br>
            Oh, how do we do these niggas, but I'm not gonna cry<br>
            I'm a Bad Boy killer, Jay-Z die too<br>
            Looking out for Mobb Deep, nigga, when I find you<br>
            Weak motherfuckers don't deserve to breathe<br>
            How many niggas down to die for me? Yay-yay<br>
            West Coast rider, coming right behind ya<br>
            Should have never fucked with me<br>

            The new word, follow me<br>
            Remember what my pops told me<br>
            <br>
            <i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            My family tree consists of drug dealers, thugs and killers<br>
            Strugglin', known to hustle screaming, "Fuck they feelings!"<br>
            I got advice from my father, all he told me was this<br>
            Nigga, get off your ass if you plan to be rich!<br>
            There's ten rules to the game, but I'll share with you two<br>
            Know niggas gon' hate you for whatever you do<br>
            Now, rule one: get your cash on, M.O.B.<br>
            That's Money Over Bitches, cause they breed envy<br>
            Now rule two is a hard one: watch for phonies<br>
            Keep your enemies close, nigga, watch your homies<br>
            It seemed a little unimportant, when he told me I smiled<br>
            Picture jewels being handed to an innocent child<br>
            I never knew in my lifetime I'd live by these rules<br>
            Initiated as an outlaw, studying rules<br>
            Now papa ain't around, so I gotta recall<br>
            Or come to grips with bein' written on my enemy's walls<br>
            Promised if I have a seed, I'ma guide him right<br>
            Dear Lord, don't let me die tonight<br>
            I got words for my comrades, listen and learn<br>
            Ain't nothing free, get back what you earned<br>
            No doubt, getting higher than a motherfucker, bless me please<br>
            This Thug Life'll be the death of me, c'mon, yeah<br>

            Plus the media be crucifying brothers severely<br>
            Tell me I ain't God's son, nigga mom a virgin<br>
            We got evicted had to leave the 'burbs, back in the ghetto<br>
            Doing wild shit, looking at the sun, don't pay<br>
            Criminal mind all the time, wait for Judgment Day<br>
            They say Moses split the Red Sea<br>
            I split the blunt and rolled a fat one up deadly<br>
            Babylon beware, coming for the Pharoah's kids<br>
            Retaliation, making legends off the shit we did<br>
            Still bullshittin', niggas in Jerusalem waiting for signs<br>
            God coming, she's just taking her time (haha)<br>
            Living by the Nile while the water flow<br>
            I'm contemplating plots wondering where the thought'll go<br>
            Brothas getting shot, coming back resurrected<br>
            It's just that raw shit, nigga, check it (that raw shit)<br>

            Have you ever seen a crackhead, that's eternal fire<br>
            Why you got these kids' minds thinking that they evil?<br>
            While the preacher being freaky you say "honor God's people"<br>
            Should we cry when the Pope die? My request<br>
            We should cry if they cried when we buried Malcolm X<br>
            Mama, tell me am I wrong, is God just another cop?<br>
            Waiting to beat my ass if I don't go pop?<br>
            Memories of a past time, giving up cash to the leaders<br>
            Knowing damn well they ain't gonna feed us<br>
            In my brain how can you explain time in B.C<br>
            It's hard enough to live now in these times of greed<br>
            They say Jesus is a kind man<br>
            Well, he should understand times in this crime land<br>
            My Thug nation, do what you gotta do, but know you gotta change. Try to find a way to make it out the game<br>
            I leave this, and hope God can see my heart is pure<br>
            Is heaven just another door? I leave this here<br>

            I took a minus and now the hard times are behind us<br>
            Turned into a plus, now they stuck livin' blinded<br>

            All my ghetto motherfuckers be proud to be black if you proud to have this shit like this, cause ain't nobody got it like this (all my little Black seeds, born Black in the White man'z world).<br>
            All these motherfuckers wanna be like us.<br>

            Bein' born with less, I must confess only adds on to the stress<br>
            Two gunshots to my homie's head, died in his vest<br>
            Shot him to death and left him bleedin' for his family to see<br>
            I pass his casket gently askin', is there heaven for G's<br>
            My homeboy's doin' life, his baby momma be stressin'<br>
            Sheddin' tears when her son, finally ask that questions<br>
            Where my daddy at? Mama why we live so poor<br>
            Why you crying? Heard you late night through my bedroom door<br>
            Now do you love me mama? Why they keep on calling me nigga?<br>
            Get my weight up with my hate and pay 'em back when I'm bigger<br>
            And still thuggin' in his jail cell, missing my block<br>
            Hearin' brothers screamin' all night, wishing they'd stop<br>
            Proud to be black but why we act like we don't love ourselves<br>
            Don't look around busta (you sucka) check yourselves<br>
            Know what it means to be black, whether a man or girl<br>
            We still struggling, in this white man's world<br>

            Sayin', "Please show a playa love"—hold ya head! (Hold it!)<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Tyrone Wrice (2Pac):]</i><br>
            How do we keep the music playin'?<br>
            (You got to hold ya head!)<br>
            How do we get ahead? (Come on, hold ya head!)<br>
            Too many young black brothers are dyin'<br>
            (Yes, hold ya head!)<br>
            Livin' fast, too fast<br>
            (The weed got me tweakin' in my mind, I'm thinkin'…)<br>
            <br>
            <i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            God bless the child that can hold his own<br>
            Indeed, enemies bleed when I hold my chrome<br>
            Let these words be the last to my unborn seeds<br>
            Hope to raise my young nation in this world of greed<br>
            Currency means nothin' if you still ain't free<br>
            Money breeds jealousy, take the game from me<br>
            I hope for better days, trouble comes naturally<br>
            Runnin' from authorities 'til they capture me<br>
            And my aim is to spread mo' smiles than tears<br>
            Utilize lessons learned from my childhood years<br>
            Maybe Mama had it all right, rest yo' head<br>
            Tradin' conversations all night, bless the dead<br>
            To the homies that I used to have that no longer roll<br>
            Catch a brother at the crossroads<br>
            Plus nobody knows my soul, watchin' time pass<br>
            Through the glass of my drop-top Rolls; hold ya head!<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Tyrone Wrice (2Pac):]</i><br>
            How do we keep the music playin'?<br>
            (You got to hold ya head!)<br>
            How do we get ahead? (C'mon, hold ya head!)<br>
            Too many young black brothers are dyin'<br>
            (Yes, hold ya head!)<br>
            Livin' fast, too fast<br>
            (You got to hold ya head!)<br>
            (How do we keep the music playin'?)<br>
            (Yes, you got to hold ya head!)<br>
            How do we get ahead?<br>
            <br>
            <i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            No matter how hard it get, feel me?<br>
            Get the weed, drink a drink, read a book<br>
            Watch the stars, get some pussy—whatever!</p>

            Talking 'bout he left the hospital, took five like me<br>

            Tryin' to player hate on my shit, you eat a fat dick<br>
            Let it be known, this is how you made me<br>

            A real live tale about a snitch named Haitian Jack<br>
            Knew he was workin' for the feds<br>

            And did I mention?<br>

            Last words to a bitch nigga: "Why you lie?"<br>

            And that nigga that was down for me, restin' dead<br>
            Switched sides, guess his new friends wanted him dead<br>
            Probably be murdered for the shit that I said<br>
            I bring the real, be a legend, breathin' or dead<br>
            Lord, listen to me, God don't like ugly, it was written<br>
            Ayo, Nas, your whole damn style is bitten<br>
            You heard my melody, read about my life in the papers<br>

            So what's a "hasa", Nas? Niggas that don't rhyme right<br>
