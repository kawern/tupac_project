            <i>[2Pac]</i><br>
            If I could recollect before my hood days<br>
            I sit and reminisce, thinkin' of bliss and the good days<br>
            I stop and stare at the younger<br>
            My heart goes to 'em, they tested with stress that they under<br>
            And nowadays things change<br>
            Everyone's ashamed of the youth 'cause the truth look strange<br>
            And for me it's reversed<br>
            We left 'em a world that's cursed, and it hurts<br>
            'Cause any day they'll push the button, and all good men<br>
            Like Malcolm X or Bobby Hutton died for nothin'<br>
            Don't it make you get teary? The world looks dreary<br>
            When you wipe your eyes, see it clearly<br>
            there's no need for you to fear me<br>
            If you take your time and hear me<br>
            Maybe you can learn to cheer me<br>
            It ain't about black or white, 'cause we human<br>
            I hope we see the light before it's ruined; my ghetto gospel<br>

            Tell me, do you see that old lady? Ain't it sad?<br>
            Livin' out of bag but she's glad for the little things she has<br>
            And over there, there's a lady, crack got her crazy<br>
            Guess who's givin' birth to a baby?<br>
            I don't trip or let it fade me<br>
            From out of the fryin' pan we jump into another form of slavery<br>
            Even now I get discouraged<br>
            Wonder if they take it all back, will I still keep the courage?<br>
            I refuse to be a role model<br>
            I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottles<br>
            I make mistakes but learn from every one<br>
            And when it's said and done<br>
            I bet this Brother be a better one<br>
            If I upset you don't stress, never forget<br>
            That God isn't finished with me yet<br>
            I feel his hand on my brain<br>
            When I write rhymes I go blind and let the Lord do his thang<br>
            But am I less holy 'cause I chose to puff a blunt<br>
            And drink a beer with my homies?<br>
            Before we find world peace, we gotta find peace and end the war in the streets; my ghetto gospel<br>

        <p><i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            Hahahaha, man, you crazy<br>
            <br>
            See, it ain't easy bein' me<br>
            Life as a celebrity is less than heavenly<br>
            I got these fakes and these back-stabbers chasing me around<br>
            And it's always drama, whenever I wanna get around<br>
            Momma told me, long before I ever came up<br>
            Gotta be true to what you do and keep the game up<br>
            'Cause things change, and jealousy becomes a factor<br>
            Best friends at your wife's house, tryin' to mack her<br>
            I'm on tour, but still they keep on knockin' at my door<br>
            And I got no time to worry, I'm steady wanting more<br>
            Every day is a test, yes, I try hard<br>
            But I'm strugglin' with every breath, I pray to God<br>
            That the woman that I left at home, all alone<br>
            There ain't nothing like tryin' to bone, over the phone<br>
            In my mind I can see her naked, I can't take it<br>
            Got me shaking at the thought that we can make it<br>
            I thought you knew<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Nate Dogg:]</i><br>

            You getting mad, 'cause you think I'ma sway<br>
            Some of 'em cute, some of 'em fine as fuck<br>
            I hear 'em scream soon as I hit the stage, nah...<br>
            Still I be getting lonely for you<br>
            I'm coming home soon as I make this pay, make this pay<br>
            <br>
            <i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            I call you up long distance, on the telephone<br>
            Wanna tuck you in even though I can't make it home<br>
            I whisper things in your ear like you're near me<br>
            Wonder if you feel me from far away, and can you hear me?<br>
            It seems to me, that you're jealous<br>
            'Cause I'm hustling and making money with the fellas<br>
            In the back streets, tryin' to track me, baby, hold up!<br>
            Thugs get lonely too, but I'm a soldier<br>
            And there's no way I'ma stop making money<br>
            'Cause your attitude's changed and you're acting a little funny<br>
            Always complaining, saying we don't spend time<br>
            Can't you see I got enough stress on my mind?<br>
            And hanging up like you all that<br>
            Then get mad when I tell you that I'm busy, baby, call back<br>
            Please, ain't nothing left to say to you<br>

            As soon as I leave the house you wanna page me<br>
            See you got me trapped I'm going crazy this is slavery<br>
            You act like it's outrageous, just give me space and we'll get better<br>
            And maybe we won't argue and be through with all these sorry letters<br>
            Soon as I come home it's like I get the third degree<br>
            Where you been and who you with, I get no room to breathe<br>
            It makes me wanna leave, I'm sick of these tricks up your sleeve<br>
            Your suspicious I deceive, gimme grief when poppa leave<br>
            But to me, if you really trust me then it's pitiful<br>
            Question me about my whereabouts, that's so trivial<br>
            Let me live my life and you can live yours<br>
            Just be there to help me and support me that's what you're here for<br>
            Not to give me stress and add to pressure<br>
            Home is where I go to rest, I go to pass the test<br>
            I'm sorry if I left you all alone<br>
            But I couldn't make it home, so we argue on the phone<br>
            Don't you trust me?<br>

            Calling at my house then hanging up, you think that makes sense?<br>
            Tell me what it takes for us to shake so we can be friends<br>
            It's time for us to take our separate paths<br>
            We had a lot of laughs but the good's become the past<br>
            Let's make it an even break, don't make it scandalous<br>
            Try and be mature, I'm pretty sure that we can handle this<br>
            You're saying I'm too busy, I ignore you<br>
            I guess you didn't hear me when I said that I cared for you<br>
            But now it seems the arguments are nightly<br>
            I wanna hold you tightly but instead you wanna fight me<br>
            So why let it stress and aggravate me<br>
            Instead I'd rather break, hope you don't hate me<br>
            You tell me that you love me but you're lying<br>
            Fighting back the urge to just start crying<br>
            I'll wipe away your tears, come and hug me<br>

            I hang up the phone, I can't bear to hear you yelling at me<br>
            Maybe we should end it, neither one of us are happy<br>
            You know that I'm emotional, you know me<br>
            Coming over crying just to get me feeling guilty<br>
            You and me were meant to be and yet<br>
            You always wanna sweat, how much closer can we get<br>
            Don't fret, just let me pack my things and I'll be outtie<br>
            This time I'm breaking out, you let your mouth overcrowd me<br>
            I can't take the beefin and the griefin<br>
            I get no room to sleep, I hope to see some cause I'm leaving<br>
            Maybe next time you'll be a little more sure<br>
            And I can give you more when you mature<br>
            But, baby, until then I gotta leave ya<br>
            It's not that I don't need ya but see ya<br>
            And I hope you understand why I'm busting<br>

        <h2>Po Nigga Blues - Scott Storch Remix</h2><br>
        <p>Scott, Storch. Hey!<br>
            <br>
            <i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            Why'd you slang crack? I had to<br>
            Why'd you slang crack? Cause I had to<br>
            Why'd you slang crack? Cause I had to<br>
            A nigga gotta pay the fuckin' rent<br>
            <br>
            <i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            Crazy, I gotta work with what'chu gave me<br>
            You claiming I'm a criminal and you the one that made me<br>
            They got me trapped in this slavery<br>
            Now I'm lost in this holocaust heading for my grave G<br>
            I told Sam he could fuck the war<br>
            And got a busted jaw for saying "Fuck the law"<br>
            And if you wonder why I'm mad check the record<br>
            What's a nigga gotta do to get respected?<br>
            Sometimes I think I'm getting tested<br>
            And if I don't say "yes" a nigga's quick to get arrested<br>
            That's the reason I stay testing<br>
            I keep a vest on my chest in case the cops are getting restless<br>
            Walking around, ready to light shit up<br>
            But since my life is fucked, some say I'm slightly nuts<br>
            Buck buck is the sound as I move up<br>
            Other niggas pay attention when a fool bust, huh<br>
            They make a nigga be a killer; I used to be a dealer<br>
            But they wanted to see who's realer<br>
            Now them same motherfuckers wanna murder me<br>
            And I wonder if the Lord ever heard of me, huh<br>
            I need loot, so I'm doing what I do<br>
            And don't say shit until you walked in my shoes<br>
            There was no other destiny to choose<br>
            I had nuttin left to lose, so I'm singing nigga blues<br>
            <br>
            <i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            Why'd you slang crack? I had to<br>

            A nigga gotta pay the fuckin' rent<br>
            <br>
            <i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            Poppa need brand new shoes, but what the fuck can a nigga do?<br>
            My little boy gotta eat too<br>
            So why must I sock a fella<br>
            Just to live large like Rockefeller?<br>
            And did you ever stop to think<br>
            I'm old enough to go to war, but I ain't old enough to drink<br>
            Cops wanna hit me with the book, huh<br>
            And you're hooked on my "I Don't Give a Fuck" look<br>
            Make your rules, I'mma break 'em<br>
            No matter how much you make 'em, you show me bacon I'mma take 'em<br>
            So don't you ever tempt me<br>
            I'm a fool for mine nigga and my pockets stay empty<br>
            To my brothers in the barrio<br>
            You're living worse than the niggas in the ghetto so<br>
            I give a fuck about your language or complexion<br>
            You got love from the niggas in my section<br>
            You got problems with the punk police?<br>
            Don't run from the chumps, get the pump from me<br>
            We ain't free, I'll be damned if I play the trick<br>
            For a blond-haired, blue-eyed, Caucasian bitch<br>
            Down with my homeboy Rich, huh<br>
            Fuck a snitch and a groupie-ass bitch<br>
            And the nigga with a cellular phone, leave his baby at home<br>
            So he can go out and bone, huh<br>
            And you wonder why we blazing niggas<br>
            Cause you punks having babies can't raise the niggas<br>
            And they down to be fuck-ups too<br>
            Drinking forties of brew, huh, singing nigga blues<br>
            <br>
            Why'd you slang crack? Cause I had to<br>
            Why'd you slang crack? Cause I had to<br>
            Why'd you slang crack? Cause I had to<br>
            Now I'm heading for the motherfuckin' pen<br>

        <h2>Crooked Nigga Too - Raphael Saadiq Remix</h2><br>
        <p>Yo 'Pac yo, I heard you got beat up by the police<br>
            Got a big fat lawsuit and everything<br>
            Niggas just wanna know<br>
            If you still gon' be on some crooked-ass sheeeit<br>
            <br>
            <i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            Please tell me what's a nigga to do, and it's true<br>
            Ain't nuttin new, so I do, what I can to get through<br>
            Now first they had me trapped and now I'm pissed<br>
            A loaded AK-47 lay under my head so I don't trip<br>
            One motherfucker from the Underground<br>
            And Big Stretch bucking niggas if they fuck around<br>
            Yo why I got beef with police?<br>
            Ain't that a bitch that motherfuckers got a beef with me<br>
            They make it hard for me to sleep<br>
            I wake up at the slightest peep, and my sheets are 3 feet deep<br>
            I guess it's hard for you to see<br>
            But now I'm pointing the finger at police<br>
            Instead of them motherfuckers blaming me<br>
            I got the right to bear a pistol<br>
            And when the punk motherfuckers get to tripping I got shit too<br>
            And maybe then you'll see the truth (hell yeah)<br>
            But until then, I gotta do what I do<br>
            And stay a crooked nigga too<br>

            <i>[Big Syke:]</i><br>
            My mama say I'm crazy cause I'm all about the hood<br>
            I can't get my shit together but I'm on leather and wood<br>
            And the hood is all I know, patrol and circle the block<br>
            Off the curb and niggas swerve, serve a smoker a rock<br>
            And I'm hot like fish grease and nigga so is my Caddy<br>
            And I'm steady catching static, move the traffic to the alley<br>
            Out in Cali niggas rally others all for the soil<br>
            Mix the work with baking soda and get the water to boil<br>
            OH NO can't no busters hang, I hope you feel me mayne<br>
            Cause snitches bitches and they ain't been loyal to the game<br>
            My niggas feel my pain, when sunshine turn to rain<br>
            You know these buster motherfuckers came to fuck the game<br>
            And it's a shame I see the mark in they eyes<br>
            When they yelling that he telling get to me, no surprise, nigga<br>
            <br>
            "Prince of peace must hear our plea"<br>
            "Told life you'd be back" "There you were"<br>
            "Prince of peace must hear our plea"<br>
            "Everybody look around" "There is no hope"<br>
            "Prince of peace must hear our plea"<br>
            "Brothers we better get hip"<br>
            <br>
            "And come off this trip"<br>
            <br>
            <i>[DJ Quik:]</i><br>
            Loyalty, undeservedly, never heard of me<br>
            I, be the exception, the epitome of adaption<br>
            The superficial surroundings, bullets fiends cockhounds and<br>
            Enemies in my family extorting scheming and scamming me (pop pop)<br>
            I'm like Bruce Nolan, I'm rollin' until the diesel hit me<br>
            I'm battered and bruised, and madder having to choose<br>
            'tween happiness and the blues, and who be filling my shoes<br>
            When I done had it with crews, ecstatic to see me lose<br>
            But panic when I be smooth, I'm manic but I'm no fool<br>
            Y'all rapping I'm talking cool, and Columbine is not new<br>
            In Compton they shoot up schools too, riding by to see who's who<br>
            Cock the shotty they cruise through, rock the body blood ooze through<br>
            Tell his family that dude's blue, no coming back<br>
            From him scrapping when niggas was packing and he wasn't packing too<br>
            So if you feel me you know when they try to kill me they slow<br>
            I seen from 'round the corner with mirrors and creeped up on 'em<br>
            <br>
            "Prince of peace must hear our plea"<br>
            "Told life you'd be back" "There you were"<br>
            "Prince of peace must hear our plea"<br>
            "Everybody look around" "There is no hope"<br>
            "Prince of peace must hear our plea"<br>
            <br>
            "Thugs throw like wine down a nigga's throat<br>
            If this shit don't STOP STOP STOP STOP STOP!"</p>
