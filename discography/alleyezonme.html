                                        What really go on in the mind of a nigga<br>
                                        that get down for theirs<br>
                                        Constantly, money over bitches<br>
                                        Not bitches over money<br>
                                        Stay on your grind, nigga<br>
                                        My ambitions as a ridah<br>
                                        My ambitions as a ridah<br>
                                        <br>
                                        So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars<br>
                                        This life as a rap star is nothing without guard<br>
                                        Was born rough and rugged, addressing the mass public<br>
                                        My attitude was "fuck it," because motherfuckers love it<br>
                                        To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease<br>
                                        Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be<br>
                                        Uh, and my ambitions as a ridah<br>
                                        To catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her<br>
                                        Then I spit some game in her ear, "Go to the telly, hoe!"<br>
                                        Equipped with money in a Benz 'cause, bitch, I'm barely broke<br>
                                        I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feeling crucial<br>
                                        From player to player the game's tight, the feeling's mutual<br>
                                        From hustlin' and prayers<br>
                                        To breaking motherfuckers to pay up<br>
                                        I got no time for these bitches, 'cause these hoes try to play us<br>
                                        I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mill, so I'm wishin'<br>
                                        Competition got me ripped on that bullshit they stressin'<br>
                                        I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory<br>
                                        No guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted<br>
                                        Now it's on and it's on because I said so<br>
                                        Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row<br>
                                        Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious<br>
                                        Started plottin' and plannin' on schemes to come and trick us<br>
                                        But thug niggas be on point and game tight<br>
                                        Me, Syke and Bogart strapped up the same night<br>
                                        Got problems, then handle it, motherfuckers see me<br>
                                        These niggas is jealous<br>
                                        'Cause deep in they heart they wanna be me<br>

                                        Hopin' you listen, I catch you payin' attention<br>
                                        To my ambitions as a ridah<br>

                                        <br>
                                        Peep it, it was my only wish to rise<br>
                                        Above these jealous coward motherfuckers I despise<br>
                                        When it's time to ride<br>
                                        I was the first off this side, give me the 9<br>

                                        So open fire, I see you kill me, witness my steel<br>

                                        I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed<br>
                                        Mama, come rescue me, I'm suicidal, thinking thoughts<br>
                                        I'm innocent, so there'll be bullets flyin' when I'm caught<br>
                                        (Shoot!) Fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrificin'<br>
                                        Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson<br>
                                        Thuggin' for life, and if you right, then nigga die for it<br>

                                        Let's get ready to rumble<br>
                                        <br>
                                        My murderous lyrics<br>
                                        Equipped with spirits of the thugs before me<br>
                                        Pay off the block, evade the cops<br>
                                        'Cause I know they coming for me<br>
                                        I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years<br>
                                        Now I'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears<br>
                                        Question my methods to switch up speeds<br>
                                        Sure as some bitches bleed<br>
                                        Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed<br>
                                        Blast me, but they didn't finish, (buck buck buck buck buck)<br>
                                        didn't diminish my powers<br>
                                        So now I'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace, they cowards<br>

                                        Had bitch ass niggas on my team, so indeed they wet me up<br>
                                        But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated<br>
                                        At the time I contemplate the way that God made it<br>
                                        Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary<br>
                                        For money I'll have these motherfuckers buried<br>

                Leavin' motherfuckers aborted with no verbal support<br>
                And when I command the microphone I get deadly as Khan though<br>
                With a bear and a snake and a panda, I'm all those<br>
                Who can withstand the more power I gain<br>
                And make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck your brain<br>
                Imagine and keep on wishin' upon a star<br>

                When I penetrate, it's been withstandin', faded<br>

                I use my mental to assassinate assassin's for those askin''<br>
                Opposed to laughin', raw maniacal villain<br>
                Laughter enhances the chances of the killin'<br>
                Why is that? Cause smilin' faces deceive<br>
                You best believe: to MC's, I'm the deadliest disease<br>
                My thoughts rip your throat and make it hard to breathe<br>
                Your whole camp's under siege and I'm Jason Voorhees<br>
                In the heat of the night is when I defeat and ignite mics<br>
                My verbal snipe your vocabs on site<br>
                I'm out the cut, uncut and raw with no clause for all<br>
                So all my rhymes hit and split the bricks on the wall<br>
                You already have an idea about the superior sphere<br>
                The greater rhyme creator on both sides of the equator<br>
                I rock from here to there, to Philly and back<br>
                To LA on the spot where I rock and bust like straps<br>
                As your views get overshadowed when you come in contact<br>
                Beware, set and prepare to enter verbal combat<br>

                            Raised as G's, loc'ed out and blazed the weed<br>

                            2 in the morning and we still high assed out<br>
                            Screaming "thug till I die" before I passed out<br>
                            But now that you're gone, I'm in the zone<br>
                            Thinking I don't wanna die all alone, but now ya gone<br>
                            And all I got left are stinkin' memories<br>
                            I love them niggas to death, I'm drinkin' Hennessy<br>
                            While trying to make it last<br>
                            I drank a fifth for that ass when you passed<br>

                            Taken risks, while keeping cheap tricks from getting on her<br>

                            But now you buried. Rest, nigga, cause I ain't worried<br>
                            Eyes blurry saying goodbye at the cemetery<br>

                            We used to be like distant cousins<br>
                            Fightin', playin' dozens, whole neighborhood buzzin'<br>
                            Knowin' that we wasn't<br>
                            Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs<br>
                            I'm gettin' blitzed and I reminisce on all the times we shared<br>
                            Besides, bumpin' 'n grindin' wasn't nothin' on our mind<br>
                            In time we'd learned to live a life of crime<br>
                            Rewind us back to a time was much too young to know<br>
                            I caught a felony lovin' the way the guns blow<br>
                            And even though we separated, you said that you'd wait<br>
                            Don't give nobody no coochie while I'll be locked up state<br>
                            I kiss my momma, goodbye, and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes<br>
                            Said I'll return but I gotta fight the fate's arrived<br>
                            Don't shed a tear, cause momma I ain't happy here<br>
                            I blew trial, no more smiles for a couple years<br>
                            They got me goin' mad<br>
                            I'm knockin' busters on they backs, in my cell, thinkin'<br>
                            "Hell, I know one day I'll be back"<br>
                            As soon as I touch down<br>
                            I told my girl I'll be there, so prepare, to get fucked down<br>
                            The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin' at 'cha<br>

                                    My fantasies came true with Janet on, I'm in a escapade<br>
                                    But did it all, end too soon<br>

                                    Then it's only right for me to disappear into the night<br>

                                    Since I'm only here for one night<br>
                                    I got to get you hot and heated<br>
                                    Play like Micheal Jackson, and Beat It<br>

                                    cause there's someone else who deserves my attention<br>
