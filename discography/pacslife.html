            I'm stressin', but ain't no pressure here, I been there before<br>
            Fugitive, task force at my girlfriend door<br>

            Outlaw, and best believe they won't take me alive<br>
            I'm different, and I'ma prove it if it take me to die<br>
            Knew that God had a plan for me<br>
            But he won't be layin' up in my casket<br>
            Or doing life in the can for me<br>
            Maybe I'm breezy or paranoid than a bitch<br>

            I always thought I'd have to die to do a record with Pac<br>
            So I wrote from the perspective of a graveyard box<br>
            You end up in a box, 'cause them graverobbin' bastards<br>
            Dig your grave back up, snatched you out the casket<br>
            Worms in my eyes, eatin' through my cabbage<br>
            The flesh to the bones, the bones to the ashes<br>
            But I'm not dead, I'm actually in a session<br>
            With the Pac keepin' the shot money, progressive<br>
            They don't really want no drama, I know you're goons<br>
            That's why I keep pressure on them, like a open wound<br>
            This God-given, he keep givin' me better music<br>
            So every time you hear me, my songs present improvement<br>
            Y'all can't kill me, y'all forever losin'<br>
            Songs are evolution<br>
            If I load your gun for you and we bang it out at some other niggas, you better shoot it<br>
            Don't try to lie and say you was bustin'—I'm clever, stupid!<br>
            Claimin' you reppin' Ruthless<br>
            You got the same bullets that you had<br>

            Tonight is love making, take you any place you wish<br>
            Today we're satisfied, yesterday we've stolen kisses<br>
            Blind insanity, perfect pictures of me and my family<br>
            Not understanding the destiny, had they planned for me?<br>
            If I have kids, will I live to see them grow?<br>
            Though I don't know<br>
            I live the life of a thug nigga until the day I go<br>
            No broken promises, a sacred bond broken<br>
            I know I die alone, but yet and still I'm hopin'<br>
            Visions of prisons, maybe I'll be forgiven<br>
            I know it's better in Heaven, 'cause being here ain't livin'<br>
            Close my eyes and see nothing but pain, the world is crazy<br>
            Still, looking for a queen to plant seeds and have babies<br>
            Maybe I'll be the one or just maybe I'm lost<br>

        <h2>Soon as I Get Home</h2><br>
        <p><i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            Dear baby, it's me again, stuck inside this max pen<br>
            Tryna pay my debt for all my sins<br>
            See, these penitentiary times be so heavy on my mind<br>
            At times it's like I'm living just to die<br>
            I'm living in hell, stuck in my jail cell<br>
            Stranded in the county jail, waiting for my chance to post bail<br>
            I wanna be paid in large stacks and mash in fast Jags<br>
            I blast and wonder "How long will I last?"<br>
            My memories fade when I'm intoxicated<br>
            Busters are shady, so I'm dumping on cowards<br>
            Crazy whenever faded<br>
            I know I said it all before, but now I mean it<br>
            Visions of me and you ballin', so crystal clear I seen it<br>
            Even though you mad at me<br>
            You'll be glad to see the strategy<br>
            Of making these chips come so easily<br>
            I max out in the morning, baby, life is good<br>
            Me and you against the whole hood, soon as I get home<br>
            <br>
            <i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            Grab my straps, locate my comrades<br>
            Let's get my enemies not knowing I'm coming back<br>
            Soon as I get home<br>
            Go get the money out the safe<br>
            It's time to turn the streets into a war zone<br>
            Soon as I come home<br>
            <br>
            <i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            Sittin' here looking at pictures of me and you livin'<br>
            But now you out in the world, while I'm twistin' in prison<br>
            Love letters come daily, words of affection<br>
            You send me money and nude pictures beggin' for some sexin'<br>
            Stay wide open, keep your eyes peeled<br>
            And my advice is "Keep it real or you can die squealin'."<br>
            Plus I never had to worry 'bout a visit<br>
            ‘Cause you're there daily<br>
            Guards tryna get your number, you don't dare tell me<br>
            Tongue-kissing, steady humpin', tryna touch up somethin'<br>
            Before the C-O in the corner jump in, frontin'<br>
            Late night reminiscing, everybody's quiet<br>
            I think something's in the air, prepare for the riot<br>
            It's padlocks in my socks, steel from the bed springs<br>
            I touch 'em with thug love and then let they heads ring<br>
            I started a war, but now I'm gone<br>
            Release me to the streets in the morning<br>
            It's on, soon as I get home<br>

            Since you've been gone<br>
            My whole life's been like a game of Cee-low<br>
            Thinking big, like the kid from Casino<br>
            Fulfillin' my dreams, like Nino<br>
            Brown, the whole town be shook up<br>
            And me and mama surviving<br>
            Depends on how many rocks a nigga cook up<br>
            Narcotics got traffic, seen those niggas you blasted<br>
            Wanting me in a casket, on a ground, kind of plastic<br>
            Yeah, nigga, I heard, Lil' Mu gave the word<br>
            You get paroled on the third, it's all love<br>
            We out here frontin', still here but all about nothin'<br>
            But double O's is what I'm wantin'<br>
            And I'm tryna see somethin' that we ain't never had<br>
            Luxury life, results living bad<br>
            Tricks of the trade, shit that should've been taught by Dad<br>
            But learned through the crew<br>
            Lessons between me and you<br>
            And once we lock this shit down it ain't a thing they can do<br>
            Meanwhile I stay waiting by the phone<br>
            Hoping I'll get a call telling a nigga that you home<br>

            Tonight is love makin', take you any place you wish<br>
            Today we're satisfied, yesterday we've stolen kisses<br>
            Blind insanity, perfect pictures of me and my family<br>
            Not understanding the destiny, had they planned for me?<br>
            If I have kids, will I live to see them grow?<br>
            Though I don't know, I live the life of a thug nigga<br>
            Until the day I go, no broken promises<br>
            A sacred bond broken, I know I die alone<br>
            But yet and still I'm hopin'<br>
            Visions of prisons, maybe I'll be forgiven<br>
            I know it's better in heaven cause bein' here ain't livin'<br>
            Close my eyes and see nothing but pain, the world is crazy, still<br>
            Lookin' for a queen to plant seeds and have babies<br>
            Maybe I'll be the one or just maybe I'm lost<br>

            When we first hung out together, I met you with the homie<br>
            We had no intentions of becoming homies<br>
            But at no time at all, you became my dog<br>
            You showed me how to roll blunts, we used to bounce and ball<br>
            I was living on Wilshire in the penthouse suites<br>
            Had my lil' cousin Daz hook you up with some beats<br>
            It was Outlaw, Dogg Pound, Death Row Records, man we tore up the town<br>
            Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre and now we got Pac, it felt like a drizzeam<br>
            Remember when I told Suge to put you on the tizzeam<br>
            And you know that I was true<br>
            Cause I took the focus off of me to put 'All Eyez On You'<br>
            And we became the most hunted together, '2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted'<br>
            And our relationship was genuine<br>

            But still struggling like Mumia Abu, it was 'bout to end truly I knew<br>
            Named my daughter Assadah, for that alone, make 'em more than a rider<br>
            Got every homie trigger finger under the set<br>
            Dope but guaranteed now my 1 on 1 will connect<br>
            <br>
