        <p><i>[Speaking:]</i><br>
            The only way, for me to come back, is by Makaveli<br>
            That's it! All these motherfuckers stole from me<br>
            I'm taking back what's mine<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Slowed down voice:]</i><br>
            You motherfuckers can't stop me (laughing)<br>
            Even if I die, I'm gon' be a fuckin' problem<br>
            Do you believe in ghosts, motherfucker?<br>
            Real live black... ghosts<br>
            Feel me?<br>
            <br>
            Some say I'm crazy, these punk-ass cops can't fade me<br>
            Mama tried to raise me, but had too many babies<br>
            Papa was a motherfuckin', joke<br>
            Used to find dope in his coat<br>
            And nearly choked when he'd tell me not to smoke<br>
            Damn, don't get me started<br>
            My mama smoked so God damn much<br>
            when she was pregnant I'm surprised I ain't retarded<br>
            At night I can't sleep, count sheep<br>
            As they pass through the glass of my neighbors five deep<br>
            Staring at the wall, heard a scream<br>
            Wake up in the mornin'<br>
            See the blood in the hall from the murder scene<br>
            Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die<br>
            As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby<br>
            On the corner, where the niggas slang they crack<br>
            And the undercovers jack those that don't watch they back<br>
            (Five-0) I daydream about the dope world<br>
            Take a puff from the blunt and watch the smoke swirl<br>
            My mossberg goes BOOM, what's another plug<br>
            Snatching drugs, pumpin' slugs in these other thugs<br>
            (GIVE IT UP NIGGA) Don't run out of breath<br>
            Every step could be death 'til you blast<br>
            And be the last nigga left, then I'll be ghost<br>
            <br>
            Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die<br>
            As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby<br>
            <i>[2x]</i><br>
            <br>
            A seven-deuce full of niggas goes by<br>
            Thought I was trippin' the second time they rolled, by<br>
            Recognized the plates, the faces looked familiar<br>
            Everybody swear they know the nigga that's gonna, kill ya<br>
            Don't murder me murder me, killa a nigga in his sleep<br>
            Let me die as I rest in peace, deep<br>
            Back to these niggas in the seven-deuce<br>
            A Mac-10 out the window bout to let it loose, what could I do<br>
            Run for cover and return fire<br>
            DIE MOTHERFUCKIN DIE, hope your ass fry, don't ask why<br>
            But I let off everything I have<br>
            An empty clip, hit the ground as a nigga dash<br>
            On my ass was the motherfuckin cops now<br>
            Barely breathing trying to keep from getting shot down<br>
            BOO-YAOW is the sound, bullet whizzed by<br>
            Still running like a nigga got nine lives<br>
            Don't know why but I'm running to my fucking block<br>
            Took a shot, tired of running from the niggas and the cops<br>
            Time to be a ghost<br>
            (Hey man, come the fuck on)<br>
            And then we'll be ghost<br>
            <br>
            Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die<br>
            As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby<br>

        <h2>One Day at a Time [Em’s Version]</h2><br>
        <p><i>[2Pac:]</i><br>
            Sometimes it's hard to wake up in the morning<br>
            Mind full of demons, I don't wanna hear 'em anymore<br>
            Got me heartbroken,fine, so many babies screaming<br>
            'Cause they seeing destruction before they see a human being<br>
            So they start smokin' weed, we'll never get our day<br>
            Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape <br>
            'Cause they all broken, why do ghetto birds die<br>
            Before we learn to fly? Somebody else should try<br>
            Cockin' guns, smokin', we can all make a change<br>
            So I'm told, but I haven't seen a change unfold<br>
            I'll keep hoping, please, if you prefer to breathe<br>
            Communities in need of people that will lead<br>
            Keep your eyes open, I can only say I'll try<br>
            Until the day I die, I promise to be wise<br>
            With my heart open, greed brings only misery<br>
            Away the tragedy, so I stay sucker free<br>
            Only a few chosen rise, my ghetto queens rise<br>
            Don't be afraid to try, too many of us die<br>
            For the door to open wide, my brothers speak wise<br>
            Stay focused on the prize, though everybody dies<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Eminem:]</i><br>
            We can only learn to take, our anger and our hate<br>
            Control our mental states, settle down and set it straight<br>
            Maybe we can learn to take a second to pump the brakes<br>
            Before we said it, regret it later and let it escalate<br>
            'Cause by then it's just too late, there's so much we can take<br>
            And there's only so much someone can swallow and tolerate<br>
            To the point that he just breaks, snaps, and it's all it takes<br>
            You think that we was learnin' from other rappers' mistakes<br>
            But we ain't, its grain to go against<br>
            With every artist comes the image he portrays<br>
            And the picture that he paints<br>
            But in the midst of all this anger and this angst<br>
            Never once did you heard me say I'm a gangster<br>
            And I ain't hear no complaints<br>
            But I know that I will always continue to grow<br>
            As long as I lead, and never follow in no one else's shadow<br>
            There will never be another me, and that I can guarantee<br>
            That's why the fuck I remain sucker free<br>
            To this day, the game will never be the same<br>
            No matter how much fame and success they attain<br>
            There will never be another me<br>
            And no matter what they do, there will never be another you<br>
            You can search, but you'll never find<br>
            You can try to rewind time, but in your hearts and your minds<br>
            We will never die, we are forever alive<br>
            <br>
            <i>[2Pac:]</i> And we continue growin', one day at a time<br>

            <i>[Young Noble:]</i><br>
            Don't get caught in the publicity and caught in the hype<br>
            Rappers are regular people minus money and lights<br>
            Searchin' for fortune and fame and superstardom<br>
            All the jewelry, all the cars, whose crew's the hardest<br>
            There's not a hip-hop police, the villains is watchin'<br>
            And the kids think beef is they only option<br>
            Outlawz born filthy, guilty as charged<br>
            My memories took a dive, my Machiavelli lives on<br>
            You think the industry is fun, ain't no pity with guns<br>
            And when your money is up, that's when your enemies come<br>
            So if he died and came back, would he try to save rap?<br>
            We needing a change, the drama remains the same<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Hussein Fatal:]</i><br>
            I spend my whole life fightin' myself<br>
            That I can't win, so I'm invitin' some help<br>
            And hey, now then, I take rights and no lefts<br>
            I'm still, just like a kid, lookin' for stripes on my belt<br>
            Yeah, that there is a fight in itself<br>
            So I just pray and hope God, take a light to myself<br>
            No matter how much I try, stay alive<br>
            I'ma die a man, still standin' and in love with my pride<br>
            <br>
            <i>[E.D.I. Mean:]</i><br>
            Heard frivolous beats, we past that<br>
            I'm tryin' to keep some income coming in<br>
            And collect on my ASCAP<br>
            The rappers in the game ain't changed<br>
            And I finally realize that we're not in the same game<br>
            The hatin' will never end, so I guess I'll deal with it<br>
            Them .45's will pop killas, yes, I'm still with it<br>
            The streets is military, you gotta be a soldier<br>
            Gotta stay leery, and keep your eyes on the rollers<br>
            They do what they gotta do to shackle and hold us<br>
            So we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rollin'<br>
            One way at a time, keep the faith in your mind<br>

            All I can do is get my grind on, death around the corner<br>
            <br>
            ("When we were kids, belonging felt good.")<br>
            I see death around the corner<br>
            ("But having respect, that feels even better.")<br>
            I see death around the corner<br>

            (I was raised) I was raised in the city, shitty<br>
            Ever since I was an itty bitty kitty<br>
            Drinkin' liquor out my momma's titty<br>
            And smokin' weed was an everyday thang in my household<br>
            And drinkin' liquor til' you out cold<br>
            And though I'm grown now, nigga it's still on - Pow!<br>
            Bustin on them niggas 'til they gone<br>
            How many more jealous ass bitches, comin' for my riches<br>
            Now I gotta be suspicious when I bone<br>
            Cause if I ain't sharp and heartless, them bitches'll start shit<br>
            Excuse me, but this is where we part bitch<br>
            No more game for free, please explain to me<br>
            Why niggas trip bitch, who you came to see?<br>
            Murder me now but see me later man, that's on my pops<br>
            I got homies that will hunt you 'til you drop<br>
            I hope the Lord can forgive me, I was a G<br>
            And gettin' high was a way of bein' free; I see death around the corner<br>
            <br>

            I see death around the corner<br>
            <br>
            This is for all the real motherfuckin' niggas out there<br>
            I know you ain't scared to die; we all gotta go, y'know?<br>
            A real motherfucker will pick the time he goes<br>
            And make sure he handles his motherfuckin' business<br>
            ("You think you're gonna live long enough to spend that money<br>
            You fuckin hump?" - )<br>

            I was like, this is like a fucking election<br>
            It is that<br>
            (You know what I am saying)<br>
            Me and Biggie's situation is smaller than that, it's like…<br>
            <br>
            And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?<br>
            Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?<br>
            (You don't know)<br>
            Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?<br>
            Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?<br>

            Choppin' rocks overnight. The nigga Biggie Smalls trying to turn into the black Frank White<br>

            Nigga, I'm too fat, I fuck around and catch a asthma attack<br>

            Lay back, I got some money to make, motherfucker<br>

            We was young and we was dumb, but we had heart<br>

            Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes<br>
            No hesitation in extermination of these snitches<br>
            Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me<br>
            A couple of movies, now the whole world's tryna to screw me<br>
            Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?<br>
            But stay true, sippin' 22's of brew<br>
            And now media is trying to test me<br>
            Got the press asking questions, trying to stress me<br>
            Misery is all I see, that's my mind state<br>
            My history with the police will shake the crime rate<br>
            My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested and flipped<br>
            He screamed "Thug Life!" and emptied the clip<br>
            Got tired of runnin' from the police<br>

            Everybody's swinging in the place<br>
            As I kick the J-A-Z-Z-Y style<br>
            R&amp;B mixing it with the hip hop swing beat<br>
            Champagne in my hand, it won't be long till I'm gone<br>
            It's just the same old song<br>
            <br>

            It's just a freestyle, meanwhile, we keep the beat kicking<br>
            Sweat dripping, girlies in the limo eating chicken<br>
            Oops don't get the grease on your pantyhose<br>

            If it's good and plenty, don't you know<br>
            There I go, there I go, there I go<br>
            But I don't go nowhere without my jim hat<br>
            If I'm rapping, cause she's clapping<br>
            Then I'm strapping cause I'm smarter than that<br>
            Then girlie maybe we can get along<br>

            So I'm draining entertaining, but I got fame<br>
            And the bases I touch too much for me trying to be naming<br>
            Aiyyo, you saw me on cable and grinned<br>

            Clark Gable back in Oakland its the same old song<br>

            Now I clown around when I hang around with the Underground<br>
            Girls used to frown, say I'm down, when I come around<br>
            Gas me and when they pass me they use to diss me<br>
            Harass me, but now they ask me if they can kiss me<br>
            Get some fame, people change, wanna live they life high<br>
            Same song, can't go wrong, if I play the nice guy<br>
            (Claimin' fame, must have changed, now that we became strong)<br>
            I remain, still the same (why Tu'?) cause it's the same song<br>

            As real as it seems the American Dream<br>
            Ain't nothing but another calculated schemes<br>
            To get us locked up shot up back in chains<br>
            To deny us of the future rob our names<br>
            Kept my history of mystery but now I see<br>
            The American Dream wasn't meant for me<br>
            Cause lady liberty is a hypocrite she lied to me<br>
            Promised me freedom, education, equality<br>
            Never gave me nothing but slavery<br>
            And now look at how dangerous you made me<br>
            Calling me a mad man cause I'm strong and bold<br>
            With this dump full of knowledge of the lies you told<br>
            Promised me emancipation in this new nation<br>
            All you ever gave my people was starvation<br>
            Fathers of our country never cared for me<br>
            They kept my ancestors shackled up in slavery<br>
            And Uncle Sam never did a damn thing for me<br>
            Except lie about the facts in my history<br>
            So now I'm sitting here mad cause I'm unemployed<br>
            But the government's glad cause they enjoyed<br>
            When my people are down so they can screw us around<br>
            Time to change the government now panther power<br>
            <br>
            Panther power<br>
            Panther power<br>

            <i>[Ray Luv:]</i><br>
            Coming straight that resides within<br>
            Go toe to toe with a panther and you just can't win<br>
            Suffered fame bats suppressed the rest<br>
            The rich get richer and the poor take less<br>
            The American Dream was an American nightmare<br>
            You kept my people down and refuse to fight fair<br>
            The Klu Klux Klan tried to keep us out<br>
            Besides drew they know no blacks allowed<br>
            With intimidation and segregation was a way for our freedom<br>
            But now were impatient<br>
            Blacks the other skin: dead or sell outs<br>
            Freedom, equality, then I'll yell out<br>
            "Don't you ever be ashamed of what you are<br>
            It's ya panther power that makes you a star"<br>

            My Mother never let me forget my history<br>
            Hoping I was set free chains never put on me<br>
            Wanted to be more than just free<br>
            Had to know the true facts about my history<br>
            I couldn't settle for being a statistic<br>
            Couldn't survive in this capitalistic<br>
            Government cause it was meant to hold us back<br>
            Using ignorant, drugs, to sneak attack<br>
            In my community, they killed the unity<br>
            But when I charged them, tried to claim immunity<br>
            I strike America like a case of heart disease<br>
            Panther power is running through my arteries<br>
            Try to stop oh boy you'll be clawed to death<br>
            Cause I'll be fighting for my freedom with my dying breath<br>
            Do you remember that is what I'm asking you?<br>
            You think you living free don't let me laugh at you<br>
            Open your eyes realize that you have been locked in chains<br>
            Said you wasn't civilized and stole your name<br>
            'Cause some time has passed seem you all forget<br>
            There ain't no liberty to you and me we all ain't free yet<br>

            I'm tryin' to make a million dollars outta quarter ounce<br>
            And gettin' lost on the five-o, fuck them hoes<br>
            Got a 45 screamin' about survival<br>

            Don't want to go to the pen, I'm hittin' fences<br>
            Narcs on a nigga's back, missin' me by inches<br>
            And they say how do you survive weighin' 165<br>
            In a city where the skinny niggas die?<br>
            Tell Mama don't cry<br>

            At point blank range cause he slept on the game<br>
            Ain't a damned thing changed<br>
            Shakin' the dice, now roll 'em<br>
            If you can't stand pain better hold 'em<br>

        <p>Rebel... rebel<br>
            Rebel<br>
            Rebel... rebel<br>
            <br>
            They just can't stand the reign, or the occasional pain<br>
            From a man like me, who goes against the grain<br>
            Sometimes I do it in vain<br>
            So with a little bass and treble<br>
            Hey mister, it's time for me to explain that I'm the rebel<br>
            Cold as the devil<br>
            Straight from the underground, the rebel, a lower level<br>
            They came to see the maniac psychopath<br>
            The critics heard of me, and the aftermath<br>
            I don't give a damn and it shows<br>
            And when I do a stage show I wear street clothes<br>
            So they all know me<br>
            The lyrical lunatic, the maniac MC<br>
            I give a shout out to your homies<br>
            And maybe then, the critics'll leave your boy alone, G<br>
            On the streets or on TV<br>
            It just don't pay to be, a truth tellin' MC<br>
            They won't be happy 'til I'm banned<br>
            The most dangerous weapon: an educated black man<br>
            So point blank in your face<br>
            Pump up the bass, and join the human race<br>
            I throw peace to the Bay<br>
            Cause from The Jungle to Oaktown, they backin' me up all the way<br>
            You know you gotta love the sound<br>
            It's from the rebel - the rebel of the underground<br>
            <br>
            Rebel, he's a rebel<br>
            Rebel of the underground<br>
            <i>[4x]</i><br>
            <br>
            Now I'm face to face with the devils<br>
            Cause they breedin' more rebels than the whole damn ghetto<br>
            And police brutality<br>
            Shit, it put you in the nip and call it technicality<br>
            So you reap what you sow<br>
            So reap the wrath of the rebel, jackin' 'em up once mo'<br>
            Now the fox is in the henhouse<br>
            Creepin' up on your daughter while you sleep I got her sneakin' out<br>
            2Pac ain't nothin' nice, I'll be nothin' how I wanna<br>
            And doin' what I'm gonna<br>
            Now I'm up to no good<br>
            The mastermind of mischief movin' more than most could<br>
            So sit and slip into the sound<br>
            Peep the rebel - the rebel of the underground<br>
            <br>
            Rebel, he's a rebel<br>
            Rebel of the underground<br>
            <i>[4x]</i><br>
            <br>
            They say they hate me, they wanna hold me down<br>
            I guess they scared of the rebel - the rebel of the underground<br>
            But I never let it get me<br>
            I just make another record 'bout the punks tryin' to sweat me<br>
            In fact, they tryin' to keep me out<br>
            Try to censor what I say<br>
            Cause they don't like what I'm talkin' 'bout<br>
            So what's wrong with the media today<br>
            Got brothers sellin' out cause they greedy to get paid<br>
            But me, I'm comin' from the soul<br>
            And if it don't go gold, my story still gettin' told<br>
            And that way they can't stop me<br>
            And if it sells a couple of copies, the punks'll try to copy<br>
            It's sloppy, don't even try to<br>
            I'm a slave to the rhythm, and I'm about to fly through<br>
            So, yo, to the people in the ghetto<br>
            When ya hear the bass flow, go ahead and let go<br>
            Now everybody wanna gangbang<br>
            They talkin' street slang, but the punks still can't hang<br>
            They makin' records 'bout violence<br>
            But when it comes to the real, some brothers go silent<br>
            It kinda make you wanna think about<br>
            That ya gotta do some sellin' out, just to get your record out<br>
            But 2Pacalypse is straight down<br>
            So feel the wrath of the rebel - the rebel of the underground<br>
            <br>
            2Pac is a rebel<br>
            Rebel of the underground<br>

            Is it, money or women to funny beginnings, tragic endings<br>
            I can make a million and STILL not get enough of spending<br>
            And since my life is based on sinning, I'm hell-bound<br>
            Rather be buried than be worried, living held down<br>
            My game plan to be trained and, military<br>
            Mind of a Thug Lord, sitting in the cemetery<br>
            Caught, I've been lost since my adolescence, calling to Jesus<br>
            Balling as a youngster, wondering if he sees us<br>
            Young black male, crack sales got me three strikes<br>
            Living in jail, this is hell, enemies die<br>
            Wonder when we all pass is anybody listening?<br>
            Got my, hands on my semi shotty, everybody's bitching<br>
            Please God can you understand me, bless my family<br>
            Guide us all, before we fall into insanity<br>
            I make it a point, to make my peep bumping warlike<br>
            Drop some shit, to any stupid bitches don't fight<br>

            Lo and behold you sold your soul<br>
            Nigga there's nuttin left of you<br>
            Look in the mirror, ask yourself who are you?<br>

            You can't take the pressure, you pussy<br>
            I warned you not to push me<br>
            You see me and chills run up your spine<br>
            Hardly even in the same war, but your heart ain't like mine<br>
            Press, they look at me like I'm a menace<br>

            I'm a nightmare, you see me when you dream<br>
            Wake up, turn on your TV and see my ass again<br>
