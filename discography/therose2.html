            What's in ya hand nigga, y'all listenin'<br>
            Do you understand nigga revolution, what's ya plan nigga <i>[gunshot]</i><br>
            Since my transition I've been misquoted, disrespected, turnin' over in my grave<br>
            Watchin' y'all behave as if I should be proud or something<br>
            The I hear you speak my name like I had a devine strides or something<br>
            But relgions are seldom followed and all those sould back slide easy<br>
            My life is tarnished so the whole world sees me as a menace<br>
            But I implement that hate for me with love for y'all<br>
            I look from above for y'all but I can't find my soldiers<br>
            Who's holdin' the weight of the world on they shoulders since I left<br>
            Who caught my last breath as I exhaled<br>
            Derailed from the tracks, who's ridin'<br>
            Make sure they don't destroy the art form<br>
            If they can stop me they can stop thirty more emcees before they even born<br>
            So I sacrifice the longevity in life<br>
            To make sure you got the message the way you needed it<br>
            Existence turns into a lesson to be taught<br>
            told, confessed, to be heard and heeded this<br>
            Kids walkin' these dirty roads and it's your job to pave it<br>
            You see niggas dyin' cuz of what you sayin'<br>
            Don't matter if you ain't kill 'em<br>
            If you ain't do shit to save 'em you in the way nigga<br>
            Save the day nigga or stopy playin' with 'em<br>
            I been yellin' and screamin' from my grave for ten years now<br>
            But y'all don't hear me though<br>
            Which one of you niggas is gonna step up and say, Pac I got you<br>
            GOD DAMN IT WHO SHOT YOU!?</p>

        <h2>Power of a Smile</h2><br>
        <p><i>[Layzie Bone: reciting 'Power of a Smile' poem]</i><br>
            The power of a gun can kill, and the power of fire can burn<br>
            The power of wind can chill, and the power of mind can learn<br>
            The power of anger, can raise inside until it tears you apart<br>
            But the power of a smile, especially yours, can heal a frozen heart<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Krayzie Bone over poem]</i><br>
            And tomorrow, we'll wake up with the promise of a smile, smile<br>
            Yes, maybe tomorrow, we'll wake up with the promise, of a smile<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Wish Bone]</i><br>
            Rest in peace..<br>
            Tupac, Bone Thugs<br>
            In His Own Words<br>
            Let's go<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Wish Bone]</i><br>
            And tomorrow, morrow, morrow, and tomorrow, morrow<br>
            And tomorrow, morrow, and tomorrow we<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Hook: Krayzie Bone (Wish Bone)]</i><br>
            I see the light... (and tomorrow, morrow, morrow)<br>
            I can see the light... (and tomorrow, tomorrow)<br>
            I see the light... (and tomorrow we)<br>
            See the light that shines... (and tomorrow we)<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Krayzie Bone]</i><br>
            Well, we still looking for better days<br>
            Hoping tomorrow can bring us some bigger and better things<br>
            So we can escape this maze, and they give us our change in every way<br>
            And maybe tomorrow, can bring us the truth<br>
            and there'll be no more use, for the pain and sorrow<br>
            Let's put it to use and then maybe the youth, can come and follow<br>
            And we can leave all our problems in the bottle, tomorrow<br>
            Maybe god'll wipe our eyes and we'll never have to cry no more<br>
            Or even better, have to die no more<br>
            Politicians can't tell us lies no more, he decides no more<br>
            Maybe tomorrow, it can be our daylight<br>
            Just might be our sunshine, sunshine..<br>
            Yesterday is filled with so much misery and drama<br>
            And today it don't seem like I'm getting any further<br>
            Praying tomorrow we can somehow come out of the struggle<br>
            And need no more hustle, no stumblin cause we all one muscle..<br>
            Still looking for a better day, day, and a better way, way, way..<br>
            So let's hope tomorrow... can lead us to the place we tryin to be..<br>
            In heavenly harmony, in heavenly harmony!<br>

            <i>[Wish Bone]</i><br>
            Where there's a will there's a way, don't let it stand in your way<br>
            Look 'em straight in they face, let 'em know you ain't playing no games<br>
            We searching for better days, wanna live them better ways<br>
            What I promise, heart is all you need to rock<br>
            Be honest, succeed, just look at me!<br>
            If I can do it, you can do it, we can do it, just believe, believe, believe!<br>
            When I lay down, I think about some of the wrong things I done<br>
            So I pray now, for God to erase some of that wrong<br>
            Wipe my soul clean, to be wanted, when he calls me, when he calls me!<br>
            So I can't sleep, cause I'm worried, I done did things, lord forgive me!<br>
            It's a damn shame, the things we do to get it our way!<br>
            Snitch on thugs, just to get it, your pay!<br>
            Nowadays I act right, in the past we used to fight<br>
            Where the loyalty at? Where them real street thugs? Where the thug life?<br>
            Where there's a will there's a way!<br>

            So as the hours pass by, in the event of my demise<br>
            Tell my momma not to cry, these are the words of the wise<br>
            Look at liberty needing glasses now that the promise been broken<br>
            For the better, keep on hopin, powerful words that's spoken<br>
            What I'm quotin is a G, acquired his knowledge from the streets<br>
            Makaveli, Tupac Shakur, was the rose that grew from concrete<br>
            America's most complete artist, regardless, one of the hardest<br>
            On a mission to make it better, with the soul of Malcom and Martin<br>
            Mixed with a little Garvin, today he got us callin<br>
            Our brighter star is fallen, but now before he was ballin<br>
            Out of control, quick to let a nigga know what he stood for, be a friend or foe<br>
            And I bring the truth in the booth cause ain't nobody gon help me<br>
            This is life, it's a gamble, and I'ma scramble till my pockets wealthy<br>
            F*ck what they tell me, I'm all about my biz<br>
            Bitch, street biz or showbiz, I'ma make y'all know this<br>
            And I'ma say this to every man, woman and child<br>
            Don't you ever be afraid to smile, smile for me now<br>
            And I'ma say this to every man, woman and child<br>

            so we mourn falling stars, they still living all hard<br>
            <br>

            my head be spinning, it be full of why's and the how come's<br>
            the value of life is so cheap if your skin ain't talcum<br>
            we need leaders, we looking at entertainers<br>
            it's about the cash, so we respect the biggest gainers<br>
            niggaz get paid then they run away from the community<br>
            that ain't gangsta nigga, you the opposite of Huey P<br>
            don't be confusing me with haters, player<br>

            blessed by the creator so give money nigga<br>
            just don't bring a plate of food around a hungry nigga<br>
            out on these streets the police is killing<br>

            stalk the stage with the pride of the panther<br>
            hands off Asada and the blood of a dance floor<br>
            word, rock on, throw the Tupac on<br>
            he's not gone, you hear his influence in pop songs<br>
            shine brighter than those Vegas lights<br>
            illuminating that Vegas night to the party after the fight<br>
            'til the gunshots disturb the peace like Luda<br>
            too bad he ain't a white chick in Aruba<br>
            they'd have a whole department dedicated to finding the killer<br>
            you'd see Afeni Shakur on Larry King, and motherf*cking Dennis Miller<br>
            word, Bill O'Reilly would be flapping his gums<br>
            how much respect do they have for my people?<br>
            actually none<br>
            you either do the nigga packing a gun who hate niggaz<br>
            even though every time he pass a mirror he staring at one<br>
            my man stressed 'cause of lack of funds<br>
            this the type of shit that make you wanna drown your liver<br>
            and blacken your lungs<br>

            that was our whole world, yo (still here)<br>
            this is for our fallen stars<br>
            inspired by the poets, revolutionaries, and activists<br>
            from the generation before us<br>
            come and do our thing on this microphone<br>
            when else in the history of this country<br>
            can a black man get on the microphone<br>
            and say whatever the hell he wanna say?<br>
            it's a lot of responsibility<br>
            but we standing on the shoulders of our ancestors<br>

        <h2>In the Depths of Solitude</h2><br>
        <p><i>[Ludacris]</i><br>
            <br>
            Yes, sir<br>
            This is Ludacris<br>
            in a recite to you an original poem written by my man tupac shakur<br>
            Intitled; in the depts of solitude<br>
            <br>
            And it goes with a something like this<br>
            Eh, ehhm<br>
            Yeah<br>
            <br>
            I exsist in the depths of solitude<br>
            Ponderin my true goal<br>
            Tryin to find piece of mine<br>
            And still preserve my soul<br>
            Constantly learnin to be accepted<br>
            And from all recieve respect<br>
            Never comprimising but sometimes risci<br>
            And that is my only regret<br>
            <br>
            How can there be peace<br>
            A young heart with an old soul<br>
            How can I be in the depts of solitude<br>
            When there are to inside of me<br>
            This duo within me causes the perfect oppotunity<br>
            To learn and live twice as fast<br>
            As those who accepts simplicity<br>
            <br>
            Yes<br>
            If you're reading between the lines you can understand exactly what my man<br>
            Tupac shakur was talking about mayne<br>
            You see in or outside the music industry<br>
            Everyone has heard the expression as lonely on top<br>
            Well you know<br>
            Pac was on top<br>
            It's only naturally that he exsisted<br>
            In the depts of solitude<br>
            Of course he was a young heart with an old soul<br>
            And individual with, what was a way ahead of his time<br>
            And sometimes when you are ahead of youre time<br>
            You do wonder what your true goal in life is<br>
            When you get so ovius critisising and put down for teaching<br>
            What you've learned to others<br>
            And doing what you feel is the rigth thing to do<br>
            So with that<br>
            Pac like all soldiers fought, to be accepted<br>
            Specially by those who rejected him the most<br>
            And even if you did'nt like him<br>
            You had to respect him<br>
            See nobodys perfect<br>
            And off course everyone makes mistakes<br>
            But experience is the best teaching, if you ask me<br>
            So its important to learn from each mistake<br>
            And try hard, not to make the same one twice<br>
            His only regret was making the mistake of being too overdemanding at times<br>
            But it was the wild outrages Pac<br>
            Mixed with the sensitive love in Pac<br>
            That made him almost the perfect person<br>
            Also made him learn and live twice as fast<br>
            And I'm sure, he would rather walk through life<br>
            With these multived dimentional personalities<br>
            Than to exept beeing one side than simplistic<br>
            Anyday..<br>
            <br>
            So being in the depts of solitude, if you ask me<br>
            Is were the true heros of our times stay.<br>
            <br>
            Tupac Shakur, in our hearts and our minds forever<br>
            Rest In Peace, live in harmony...<br>
            <br>
            This is Luda, signing out<br>

        <h2>When Ure Heart Turns Cold</h2><br>
        <p>
            <i>[Spoken poem]</i><br>
            When your heart turns cold<br>
            It causes your soul to freeze<br>
            Spreads through your spirit<br>
            Like a ruthless, villain disease<br>
            The walls that were once down<br>
            Now stand firm and tall<br>
            Safe from hate, love, pain, joy<br>
            Till you feel nothing at all<br>
            When your heart turns cold<br>
            A baby's cry means nothing<br>
            A dead corpse is trivial<br>
            Mothers neglecting children is daily<br>
            Lonliness becomes your routine friend<br>
            Death seems like tranquility<br>
            Sleeping is never pleasant if you even sleep at all<br>
            We forgot our deals and turn off the reason<br>
            Till the product is sold<br>
            You don't understand how I behave<br>
            Wait till your heart turns cold<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Verse 1]</i><br>
            Know my cold heart turns warm at the front door<br>
            Love my family, love my Outlawz<br>
            But when I step outside I feel my blood freezing<br>
            Question if it's a blessing that 'm still breathing<br>
            Sometimes I wonder if I'm better off dead<br>
            They say God don't make mistakes but what if he did<br>
            But what if he didn't<br>
            So I'm supposed to be living this life that I'm living<br>
            And feeling how I'm feeling<br>
            Black rain shower, the pain builds character<br>
            My heart turned cold, yeah I learned to be a scavenger<br>
            Listen, no love received and no love given<br>
            Don't blame us blame the hate that you gave the children<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Verse 2]</i><br>
            No remorse for life and y'all forced to fight<br>
            In the event of my demise I hope God's the guiding light<br>
            In hind's sight, I'm lost, misguided by lies and truths<br>
            Confused bout what to do, refer to smoking, drinking brew<br>
            We be the hearts of the heartless, riding few from the bunch<br>
            Bosses have falled, bosses have caught you don't be the next one<br>
            Sleeping never pleasant even if you sleeping at all<br>
            The reason that I'm breathing is I'm an example for y'all<br>

            It causes your soul to freeze<br>

            When your heart turns cold<br>
            You feel nothing at all<br>
            A baby's cry means nothing at al<br>
            When your heart turns cold<br>
            A dead corpse is trivial<br>
            And death seems like tranquility<br>
            When your heart turns cold<br>
            I thank God above<br>
            Through the pain, hate, joy, and love<br>

            Your lonliness becomes your only homie<br>
            So your sorrow all alone is just for your eyes only (Yeah)<br>
            The world against you and the odds are stacked (They stacked)<br>
            Your pockets short and your girls a wreck (That bitch)<br>
            Lose a piece of you survive all that<br>
            Plus you young and you black, it's hard enough being that (Yeah)<br>
            Your mom gone ain't nobody never cared (Yeah)<br>
            You call your mom but nobody never there (Shit)<br>

            When your heart turn cold that's when the heat go off<br>
            And the means die slow, that's how the streets show off<br>
            Cemetaries filled with vicitms those with cold hearts<br>
            Deep in the dark when the pistols spark<br>
            My life one big movie of strife<br>
            Scene after scene filled with nothing but sad dreams<br>
            No wonder my heart pumps ice water<br>
            Gotta live according to the lessons that life taught you<br>
            Lonley is the road of a tortured soul<br>
            Who only knows the roles of a heart turned cold<br>
            Caught in the middle when the pistols blow<br>
            That's how it go when your heart turns cold<br>

            We were both on the road, both new on the road<br>
            I was with Ice Cube, he was with Digital Underground<br>
            The first time I met a young brother who had so much power then<br>
            You know, we were on the road for a long time together<br>
            I had the oppotunity to dream with Tupac<br>
            Before his dreams became a reality<br>
            He used to always talk about music, you know<br>
            And I'm just so happy, so thankful to be a part of this project<br>
            It touches my heart to be able to give something back<br>

            <br>
            <i>[Hook x2]</i><br>
            Word is bond, bond is life<br>
            I give my life before my word shall fail<br>
            A soldier's oath, freedom of death<br>
            And I won't stop if I fail<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Verse 1]</i><br>
            If I fail get back, can't be soft got to be tough<br>
            If I fall get back, can't be soft got to be tough<br>
            If I fail get back, can't be soft got to be tough<br>
            If I fall get back, can't be soft got to be tough<br>
            <br>
            Failure, it's not an option<br>
            Real recognize real let's get it poppin'<br>
            With mathematics you can solve any problem<br>
            That's how we make it from the top to the bottom<br>
            Keep ya head up homie and stay confident<br>
            It's negativity around but I'm positive<br>
            Cuz I'm givin' everything that I got to give<br>
            Stayin' true to myself, that's how I keep it real<br>

            If I fail then I'll rise<br>
            Like a phoenix before yo eyes<br>
            Out the ashes and from the dirt<br>
            Report for duty and put in work<br>
            Eternal life, an iron will<br>
            Man sharpens man, steel sharpens steel<br>
            The hate you gave, we turn to love<br>
            Rest in peace, one thug one love<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Verse 3]</i><br>
            We can't be stopped if we don't give up<br>
            Even though they hold us back we still find ways to come up<br>
            A lot of people make promises with no plans to keep 'em<br>
            But me, no matter what I'm ridin' till I get my freedom<br>
            If I fail, then it's only a challenge to go harder<br>
            Don't want to be no martyr so I adapt to things smarter<br>
            It's death before dishonor<br>
            And I put that on my son and my momma<br>
            And don't take it as a threat, that's a promise<br>

            If in my quest to achieve my goals<br>
            I stumble or crumble or even lose my soul<br>
            Those that knew me would easily co-sign<br>
            That there was never a life as hard as mine<br>
            No father, no money, no chance, no God<br>
            I only follow my voice inside<br>
            If it guides me wrong and I do not win<br>
            I learn from mistakes and try to achieve again<br>
            Dedicated to the youth, the truth is the seed<br>
            The stronger the root, the stronger the tree<br>
            If we eat from the fruit, the stronger we be<br>
            If we do it today, tomorrow we free<br>

        <h2>Poetry</h2><br>
        <p><i>[Verse One]</i><br>
            Words are influential to my brain<br>
            See poetry is life within my veins<br>
            Keeps my heart pumpin<br>
            Pumpin that, word of life<br>
            And it appeared clear to me<br>
            That clearly, it was truthfully meant to be<br>
            So I'm constantly breathin, sleepin, eatin<br>
            Dreamin poetry<br>
            It took me some time to realize<br>
            That's when I saw life right through my eyes<br>
            I bet in the event of my demise<br>
            I will finally realize<br>
            And it appeared clear to me<br>
            That clearly, 'Pac was truly meant to be<br>
            When I saw the rose grow out the crack<br>
            of the concrete<br>

            <i>[Verse Two]</i><br>
            Poetry has a beat like no other<br>
            Words of inspiration, you can share with another<br>
            It breathes and lives with a life of passion<br>
            Who cares the style, is always in fashion<br>
            The topics are endless, and so are the meanings<br>
            The sparks that STRIKE, bring so many feelings<br>
            It's in the way I drag my S'sss<br>
            And drop my G's<br>
            That has you so in love with me<br>
            Or should I say my poetry<br>
            The chemistry is so in sync<br>
            Envy in will drive your crazy and quake your nerves<br>
            But you thought these were only words?<br>
            No it's my soul that's creepin up your back<br>
            My spirit with YOURS, is what you lack<br>
            But yet you still fail to understand me<br>
            The truth I write is never tangled<br>
            I'll rock your world, and I'll change your tastes<br>
            I move so swiftly, with so much grace<br>
            Some call me a mystery<br>
            And others can't see<br>
            But in the depths of my valley, I am called<br>
