          <br>
          <p>2Pac's third album, arriving in March 1995 as Me Against the World, is now hailed as his magnum opus, and

          <h3>Superstardom: 1995–1996</h3>
          <p>While imprisoned February to October 1995, Tupac wrote only one song, he would say. Rather, he took to
            political theorist Niccolò Machiavelli's treatise The Prince and military strategist Sun Tzu's treatise The
            Art of War.</p>
          <br>
          <p>2Pac's fourth album, All Eyez on Me, arrived on February 13, 1996. Of two discs, it basically was rap's
            first double album—meeting two of the three albums due in Tupac's contract with Death Row—and bore five
            singles while perhaps marking the peak of 1990s rap.
